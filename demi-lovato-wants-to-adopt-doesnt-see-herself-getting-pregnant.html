“I think if anything, I want to adopt, more than anything,” the singer, 28, told Joe Rogan on Saturday, March 27. “Life doesn’t go according to any plan. So, I could sit here and say, ‘Yes, I would love to have children.’ But I don’t know, because that might change next week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While<a href=#><strong> Demi Lovato</strong></a> doesn’t see any pregnancies in her future, she does want to have kids.</p><p>“I think if anything, I want to adopt, more than anything,” the singer, 28, <a href=# rel=noopener>told <strong>Joe Rogan</strong> on Saturday, March 27</a>. “Life doesn’t go according to any plan. So, I could sit here and say, ‘Yes, I would love to have children.’ But I don’t know, because that might change next week. I think in this moment, I want to adopt, for sure.”</p><p>The actress explained how her life has already shifted gears. “I don’t know, I was engaged to a man, [<a href=#><strong>Max Ehrich</strong></a>], last year. I totally thought that I’d be married, maybe pregnant, by now. And that’s not the case,” she said. “I know that my life is not going according to my plan.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Demi-Lovato-Says-She-Wants-to-Adopt.jpg><p>The former Disney Channel star added that she doesn’t know if she’ll end up with a man. “I can’t really see myself even getting pregnant,” Lovato explained during the “Joe Rogan Experience” episode. “I don’t know. I’m so fluid now, and a part of the reason why I am so fluid is because I was super closeted off.”</p><p>The Camp Rock star came out as pansexual during the interview, saying she’s attracted to “anything, really.” Lovato joked that as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, she’s “part of the alphabet mafia and proud.”</p><p>The New Mexico native opened up about previously feeling “a lot of shame” over her identity. “Any attraction I had to a female at a young age, I shut it down before I even let myself process what I was feeling,” she told Rogan, 53. “Growing up in Texas as a Christian, that’s very frowned upon.”</p><p>Earlier this month, the Grammy nominee told Glamour that <a href=#>she felt a “sense of relief”</a> in being able to “live [her] truth” after <a href=#>breaking off her and Ehrich’s engagement</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This past year, I was engaged to a man and when it didn’t work, I was like, ‘This is a huge sign,’” Lovato said at the time. “I hooked up with a girl and was like, ‘I like this a lot more.’ It felt better. It felt right.”</p><p>The former couple <a href=#>started dating in March 2020</a>, announcing <a href=#>their engagement</a> four months later. “I’m honored to accept your hand in marriage,” the then-bride-to-be wrote via Instagram in July 2020. “I love you more than a caption could express but I’m ecstatic to start a family and life with you. I love you forever my baby. My partner. Here’s to our future!”</p><p>Following their September 2020 split, a source exclusively told Us Weekly, “She’s in a really good place and already<a href=#> jumping right back into work</a> and spending time with friends and family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadnZ2eeq271ZqrqGWnlru1v4ytpmaZlKS9tXnDqJyspqRiwKaxjKGcq6uVobNus8Stq6Kml2K9s7HGp5inrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
