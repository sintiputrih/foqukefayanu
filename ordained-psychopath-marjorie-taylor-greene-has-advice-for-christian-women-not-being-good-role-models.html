The latest, it seems, is how to be a good role model for young women, which is possibly one of the last areas many would turn to MTG for advice on, right up there with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how to pronounce the word ‚Äúindictable.‚Äù</a></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>Waking up this morning with a desire to turn feminism back 60 years, Taylor Greene took to Twitter to scold her fellow ‚Äúconservative Christian women‚Äù out there who are supposedly ‚Äúselling themselves short‚Äù by ‚Äúconforming to the world‚Äôs sexualization of women‚Äù and therefore ‚Äúnot being good role models.‚Äù The further Marjorie goes into her prehistoric polemic, the more you have to balk at the unmitigated gall.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>‚ÄúMen will respect you more and think of you much more highly than just a sexual object for gratification,‚Äù she advised, presumably tweeting from somewhere in the 1700s. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also good to not tempt your Christian brothers and cause them to stumble,‚Äù she added ‚Äî a truly startling statement that is a mere tiptoe away from outright victim-blaming.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=895 data-injectable=true>‚ÄúAs conservative Christian women let us always be an example to girls and young women by displaying actions that our faith believes and not conform to the patterns of this fallen world,‚Äù Marj continued. ‚ÄúBe the light, don‚Äôt fall into the darkness.‚Äù A beautiful sentiment there, from someone who has just recently displayed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unrepentant transphobia</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">raging xenophobia</a>. Not to mention worshipping a man who literally owes a woman millions upon millions for <a href=#>being found liable for sexual abuse</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.</p><p>There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world‚Äôs sexualization of women.</p><p>If you are‚Ä¶</p>‚Äî Marjorie Taylor Greene üá∫üá∏ (@mtgreenee) <a href=#>February 22, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>Naturally, the supreme irony of MTG advising others on how to be good role models opened the door to a floodgate of mockery on social media. Not to put stock in tabloid rumors, or to pry into her private life, but Taylor Greene‚Äôs discussion of sexuality and traditional Christian values inevitably brought back memories of claims that she once had an affair with a man <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a> described as a ‚Äúpolyamorous tantric sex guru.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ahahahahhahahahahahh! YOU TALKING ABOUT BEING A ROLE MODEL?!?!?! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/s8kw6Bs5zx</a></p>‚Äî Art Candee üçøü•§ (@ArtCandee) <a href=#>February 22, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=773 data-current-count=1073 data-injectable=false>In February 2021, Taylor Greene was accused of having ‚Äúopenly cheated‚Äù on her now-ex-husband Perry Greene with two men, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CrossFit gym manager Justin Tway </a>and aforementioned guru Craig Ivey. She has denied the veracity of the claims, in the most MTG way possible, labeling them ‚Äúridiculous tabloid garbage spread by an avowed Communist.‚Äù Whether true or not, the reaction on X to her latest disturbing diatribe indicates that the accusations will continue to follow Marjorie around. Although, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> pointed out at the time, Taylor Greene actually (or openly) having polyamorous affairs with sex gurus would probably be better for the country, and perhaps women everywhere, and the whole wide world, than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting out her every threadbare thought</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmegpLmqwMicqminopmuqrrEnWSpq6mYtbC8wK2fZqWRp7ewvsieZK2ZqaG8s3nGq5yeppVitaK%2FjJqbr6GTmnqnu9FmmqGqmajBqq3NZq6opZWjeq%2B702aZnqGenHqou86dZKunnJp6rrvDnqOsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
