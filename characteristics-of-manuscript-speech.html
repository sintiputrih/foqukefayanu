They are frozen <b>style</b>, formal <b>style</b>, consultative <b>style</b>, casual <b>style</b> and intimate <b>style</b>. It means that people have <b>five</b> options of <b>styles</b> when they want to communicate with other people. For example, people use formal language in a formal place.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-elements-of-a-speech></span>What are the elements of a speech?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A <b>speech</b> is comprised of three main parts: the introduction, the main body, and the conclusion. The introduction is crucial for capturing and keeping the attention of your audience. Not only do you need them to like you and want to listen to you, but you want them to believe you, too.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-five-characteristics-of-speech-writing></span>What are the five characteristics of speech writing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Here are the <b>5</b> principles of <b>speech writing</b>:<p>Deciding the reason of the discourse.
