"Today your mom told us that you were born a month early ... and as a baby you were both 'cuddly and fussy at the same time' and I couldn't have imagined a more apt description of you," Fox wrote, alongside a photo of Kelly giving her a piggyback ride. She continued by praising her fiancé's "gentle, beautiful heart," and adding that he "is by far the most unique human I have ever met. If I could get the boy who has everything something special for his birthday — I would lift the veil off of their eyes so they could see what I see. ...Happy birthday love of my life."</p><p>According to the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, the couple celebrated with a dinner at L.A. hotspot Catch, as well as a party complete with an impressive balloon archway (peep Kelly's <a href=#>Instagram</a> for proof). Kelly's good friend and fellow musician Travis Barker wished Kelly a happy birthday in the comments and in a black-and-white Instagram Story of his own (via the Daily Mail), but it was Fox's romantic social media tribute that won over fans. Per <a href=#>BuzzFeed</a>, the actor hasn't been shy about flaunting her love for Kelly via <a href=#>gushing posts</a> in the past, but this one might just take the (birthday) cake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWxiZ4R0e8yenpqmXZu8uXnPq6avnaNiwamt02afnqpdp7KtrdOipqermJ69bsPIrZ9mpZGYtaq6xGaerqZdoLKtuNhmoKxlkah6tMDRqKWgZZGoeqbCxKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
