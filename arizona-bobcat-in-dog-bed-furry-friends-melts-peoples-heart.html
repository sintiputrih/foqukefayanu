However, their beauty has led to a looming problem.&nbsp;</p><p>While hunting them for their fur may appear as the biggest threat to bobcats’ survival, international studies suggest that the greatest danger comes from losing and disrupting their habitats due to human expansion.&nbsp;</p><p>Their territories now intersect with farms by ranchers and farmers, leading to more frequent come-ins with humans resulting in mortality due to road collisions or being killed directly.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, this means they are unable to be as active in the daytime anymore and instead have had to adapt by hunting at sunrise and sunset.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these concerns, bobcats can still be hunted through a valid license in states such as Arizona. Understanding the increasing threats and proper <a href=#>management</a> of our environment is key to preserving the lives of these captivating creatures.</p><p>Hence, the police rushed to her home to take safety measles immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Bobcats are generally shy of people, though their presence in our neighborhoods is not uncommon.&nbsp;</p><p>The Arizona Game and Fish Department urge homeowners not to panic at the sight of one, however, they must take the necessary precautions.&nbsp;</p><p>Such preventive measures include keeping small pets safely indoors or on a leash, as an enclosed yard may not suffice due to the bobcat’s ability to leap 12 feet in height and over fences.&nbsp;</p><p>In the rare instances where rabies are involved or if a bobcat appears hyperactive or bites someone, it is essential to call animal control for help or reach out to the fish and game department for assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, if attacked by a bobcat, one should fight back. The police were unable to find the bobcat but the search is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCt0aKxqKaRYq%2BwrsKaq2ahnmKxsLOMm5ydZZaqv7PFjJ%2Bpop2emcBuucSlq6xloJq8sbjErGShnZGnwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
