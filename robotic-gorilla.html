So we made sure that the gorilla had the most amount of detail put into the face.”</p><p>The crew also had to create a robotic gorilla that didn’t challenge the dominant male in the group that it was observing. “We wanted to make sure that we were not being threatening, so we averted the gaze of our spy gorilla,” explained Gordon.</p><p>By making their furry secret agent appear more submissive than dominant, the crew managed to convince the dominant male ape to accept the robot and signal to his troop that it was safe for them to approach the “stranger.”</p><p>Finally, before releasing the robot into the densely-forested Ugandan sanctuary, the crew also had to be sure that it smelled like other gorillas. “We sometimes have to anoint them in feces to allow them to be accepted into the group,” said Gordon. “It’s not the most pleasant of jobs.”</p>A clip from the PBS series shows the gorillas chorusing at suppertime in a Ugandan forest.<p>Scientists had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">already discovered</a> in 2016 that gorillas sing to themselves while eating, but that data was entirely audio-based, so the high-definition footage that Gordon and his crew managed to capture was a first.</p><p>The 2016 study also showed that older gorillas sing at dinner more often than younger ones and that male gorillas sing more often than female ones. The gorillas were also found more likely to sing while eating plants and seeds rather than insects.</p><p>This latest footage expands on the 2016 study and provides evidence that gorillas are extremely gassy and are almost constantly farting during dinner. The footage also showed that the gorillas often screamed a “chorus of appreciation” while eating.</p><p>The animatronic ape was also designed to capably beat its chest in order to engage with other apes. This resulted in a rather endearing moment of playtime between the robot and a baby gorilla that the crew miraculously captured.</p><p>“We had this wonderful, magical moment where there was this lovely to and fro between our spy gorilla and the baby gorilla,” Gordon reported. “A young gorilla came over and did the natural thing for him, which was to beat its chest. For a baby gorilla, that means ‘I want to play,’ and if our gorilla was lifeless, not moving, I think the gorilla would have lost interest. But our spy gorilla was able to beat its chest, too.”</p><p>He added, “that would be difficult to see with traditional filming techniques.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-276830 alt="Robotic Bear And Grizzly Bear" width=900 height=503 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/robotic-bear-and-grizzly-bear.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-276830 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>John Downer Productions</span><span class=caption-body>The production company created more than 50 animatronic animals, including this bear aimed to infiltrate a group of grizzlies.</span></p><p>The series hasn’t limited itself to apes, however.
