Here's how to install and set up the Nest Learning Thermostat in your own home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Warning</strong>:&nbsp;This&nbsp;is a project for a confident DIYer. There's no shame in getting someone else to do the actual wiring for you if you lack the skill or knowledge to do so. If&nbsp;you read the beginning of this article&nbsp;and immediately visualized&nbsp;how to do it based on past experience wiring switches and outlets, you're probably good. If you opened the article not sure how exactly we were going to pull this trick off, it's time to call in that wiring-savvy friend or electrician. Also note that it may be against the law, code, or regulations to do this without a permit, or it might void your insurance or warranty. Check your local regulations before continuing.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-nest-thermostat-and-why-would-i-want-one>What Is the Nest Thermostat and Why Would I Want One?</h2><p>The Nest Thermostat is one of the most popular smart thermostats on the market, mostly thanks to its unique design and easy-to-use user interface. It even allows you to control your home's heating and cooling right from your smartphone.</p><p>But it's biggest selling point is that the Nest learns your habits, and can eventually do it all automatically. So if you tend to turn down the heat when you go to bed and turn it back up when you wake up, the Nest will learn this and do it for you, without you having to program it manually.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2126_stomped.jpg><p>The Nest can also learn whether you're home or away, based on your phone's location and the Nest's built-in&nbsp;motion sensor. You can also set it manually, and tell the Nest whether you're at home or will be away for the day or weekend so that it can heat or cool your house accordingly.</p><h2 id=will-the-nest-thermostat-work-in-my-house>Will the Nest Thermostat Work in My House?</h2><p>You might think that the Nest Thermostat will work with any thermostat setup in any home, but that's not quite the case.</p><p>The Nest will work with any low-voltage system, but it won't work with high-voltage systems (also known as line voltage) at all. If you're not sure which kind of system you have, you can quickly pop off your current thermostat and take a look at the wiring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you see a handful of tiny wires in all sorts of different colors, then you likely have a low-voltage system, but if you see only 2-4 larger wires that are connected with wire nuts, then you likely have a high-voltage system. You can also look on the thermostat itself to see how many volts it is. If it reads something like "110 VAC", "115 VAC", or "120 VAC", then you have a high-voltage system and the Nest won't work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/high-voltage-stat.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/double-label.png><p>It is possible to <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">convert to a low-voltage system</a> if you have a high-voltage system, but it's pretty involved and takes a bit of know-how, so if you absolutely want to install a Nest Thermostat, it might be best to call a professional to convert your system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without all that said, if everything looks good on your end, here's how to install and set up your Nest Thermostat.</p><h2 id=step-one-remove-your-current-thermostat>Step One: Remove Your Current Thermostat</h2><p>Locate your thermostat and turn it off. It will still be powered on, but you should turn&nbsp;off the heating, cooling, and fan. It's also a good idea to remove backup batteries if your thermostat has any.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2412_stomped.jpg><p>Next, you'll need to turn off the heating and cooling at the breaker box. Sometimes, the furnace and the air conditioner are on two separate breakers, so you'll need to switch off both. Remember, this isn't just for your own safety, but not shutting off the heating and cooling completely can blow a fuse, which will require an electrician to fix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2423_stomped.jpg><p>You might also have to turn off a third breaker for the wire that gives the thermostat power. The diagram of your breaker box may say which breaker the thermostat is connected to, but if not, it's a safe bet that if your thermostat is located in your living room, turning off the breaker for the living room will do the trick.</p><p>Furthermore, your furnace's main shutoff could be next to the furnace itself, rather than on the breaker box.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2424_stomped.jpg><p>Next, remove the thermostat body from the wall. It's usually just clipped in and requires a slight tug to take it off, but you may need to unscrew yours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2413_stomped.jpg><p>From there, you'll be able to see the wiring of your thermostat. We recommend taking&nbsp;a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">voltage tester</a> and confirming that there isn't power running to it. If there is, you need to go back to the breaker box and try&nbsp;turning off another breaker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2414_stomped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This next step is important. Take a photo of the current wire setup and note where each wire is running. Most of the time, the color of the wire will correctly correspond to the letter of the screw that it's connected to (e.g. yellow wire connected to "Y", white wire connected to "W", and so on), but sometimes that isn't the case, and you might have something like a blue wire connected to "Y"--like I do in the photo below. You can also use the included wire labels in the Nest instructional booklet to mark the wires, but taking a photo and noting where the wires go is good enough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2415_stomped.jpg><p>Next, unscrew the wires from their screw terminals using the screwdriver that came with your Nest. If there are any jumper cables (i.e. short cables going from one terminal to another) you can remove them and toss them out, as you won't need them for the Nest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2425_stomped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you've disconnected all of the wires, you can completely remove the thermostat and take off the thermostat's wall plate, which is likely secured to the wall with a couple of screws.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2426_stomped.jpg><h2 id=step-two-install-the-nest-thermostat>Step Two: Install the Nest Thermostat</h2><p>Take the Nest base plate and put it on the wall where you want the Nest Thermostat to go. Use the built-in leveler to make it level. From there, use a pencil and mark where the two screws need to go--one on the top and one on the bottom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2429_stomped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there's a stud behind the drywall where you want the screws to go in, you'll need to pre-drill small holes first before screwing the base plate in. Otherwise, the included screws are self-tapping and can easily be driven into drywall without pre-drilling. Drywall anchors aren't necessary.</p><p>When you're ready to drive in the screws (a drill is highly recommended for this), place the base plate back on the wall where you want it and feed the wires through the center hole (include the trim plate behind the base plate if you want--it's good to use if you don't want to spackle and paint over the spot where the old thermostat was). Take the two screws and drive them into the wall, making sure that the plate remains level as you do so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2430_stomped.jpg><p>Next, you'll plug in the wires into the Nest's base plate. If you're not sure where each wire goes, you can use Nest's <a href=#>wiring diagram helper</a> online, which tell you which wires go into which ports, shown below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-03-31-at-12.38.54-PM_stomped.jpg><p>Before you connect the wires to the Nest's base plate, you'll need to straighten out the wires using some needle-nose pliers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2432_stomped.jpg><p>To insert and secure a wire, press down on the button and insert the wire as far as it will go. Then lift up on the button. Give the wire a nice tug to make sure that it's snug and it doesn't come out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2434_stomped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once all the wires are inserted, push the bunch inside as far as they'll go so that they're not sticking out past the base plate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2435_stomped.jpg><p>Next, take the main Nest Thermostat unit, making sure the Nest logo is at the top, and then simply push it in until it clicks into place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2437_stomped.jpg><p>Remove the plastic that covers up the motion sensor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2438_stomped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Go back to your breaker box and turn the power back on to every breaker that you turned off.
