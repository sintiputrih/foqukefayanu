Though fans have speculated for a while that her relationship with husband Dean McDermott was rocky, it's become clearer over time that their situation is far more complicated than anyone expected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a potential split apparently on the horizon, based on Tori's comments on the matter, fans got to wondering how finances factor into the equation.</p><p>Did Dean McDermott's net worth take a dive when he married Tori or were the pair once a financially solvent power couple?</p><h2 id=tori-sort-of-had-family-money>Tori Sort Of Had Family Money</h2><p>Most fans of Tori Spelling know that her late father was a super-rich Hollywood bigwig. Aaron Spelling was a multi-millionaire when he passed away, but <a href=#>neither of his children inherited as many millions</a> as they expected to.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Aaron Spelling's Net Worth Was When He Died</a></span></p><p>Plus, after inheriting what was a relatively meager amount of cash, Tori Spelling then allegedly wasted most of the funds, falling into debt in later years.</p><p>So what happened when she and Dean left their respective former spouses and got married?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dean-and-tori-39-s-spending-got-out-of-control>Dean And Tori's Spending Got Out Of Control</h2><p>When Tori and Dean got together in 2005, both were active in Hollywood, working on a Lifetime film. They were apparently making decent separate incomes, but after their marriage, financial issues began to surface.</p><p>In 2013, amid rumors of Dean having an affair, the couple revealed that they had multiple debts, including credit card and other payments they failed to make.</p><p>Celebrity Net Worth reported that in 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dean's ex stated that McDermott was behind financially</a>; he apparently didn't provide child support or other expenses for their son for many months.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Tori Spelling's Family Money After Her Dad Passed Away?</a></span></p><p>Dean's ex-wife also confirmed that her financially strapped former husband was also living in a home paid for by his mother-in-law, Candy Spelling.</p><p>Later in 2017, sources also reported that the Spelling-McDermott family owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid credit card bills, taxes, and account overdrafts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-tori-spelling-39-s-debt-impact-dean-mcdermott>How Did Tori Spelling's Debt Impact Dean McDermott?</h2><p>Before Dean and Tori got together (while they were both married to their respective exes), Dean didn't have child support or other payments to make. But it seems that connecting his finances with Tori's wasn't a good move.</p><p>Coupled with the fact that most sources say Dean hit his peak on TV and in film in the '90s, it's not surprising that his earnings haven't been that impressive over the years.</p><p>Some sources say his net worth used to be about $3 million, but that seems unlikely given his and Tori's financial issues. Not only did his divorce mean child support and other financial obligations were added to his plate, but he appeared in fewer films and shows after their coupling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps Dean's acting career was slowing anyway, like many other '90s stars' have. Yet Tori Spelling hasn't always had a great reputation in the media, and it's understandable if the couple's highly publicized relationship impacted his ability to get high-profile jobs.</p><p>The two also enjoyed a pretty lavish lifestyle, and continue to do so despite their lingering debts.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-the-couple-39-s-combined-net-worth>How Much Is The Couple's Combined Net Worth?</h2><p><a href=#>Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott's current net worth</a> is somewhere between $1 and $1.5 million, depending on the source. That's far less than Dean's standalone worth of $3 million, making it tough to discern how anyone is adding up the couple's cash resources.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also possible that their spending fluctuates wildly, depending on Dean's court judgments related to back child support and the status of their tax payments or credit card balances.</p><p>Tori was also quoted as saying she and Dean had retirement accounts but not much in the way of savings, making it even more complicated to get a clear picture of their finances.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Tori Spelling Have A High Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>What does seem clear to fans is that Dean McDermott probably hurt both his earning potential and his reputation when he stepped out on his ex-wife and wound up married to Tori Spelling.</p><p>Despite the couple's love story, which of course involved extramarital affairs (including rumored infidelity after Dean and Tori married), fans have to wonder whether the whole journey was worth it to either half of the couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trouble-in-paradise-could-mean-financial-woes>Trouble In Paradise Could Mean Financial Woes</h2><p>In late 2021, <a href=#>Tori Spelling admitted that living with Dean McDermott was making her miserable</a>. She also hinted that a prenuptial agreement was part of the reason why she hadn't filed for divorce despite their troubled marriage.</p><p>But in early 2020, the couple bought a $3.7 million dollar home, suggesting that they either had liquid reserves on hand or were able to obtain a mortgage for the mansion. Either way, they seem to have income coming in, most of which is attributed to Tori's endeavors in Hollywood rather than her husband's work.</p><p>However, Dean is working; he's appearing in a 2021 TV series that should earn him a decent paycheck. That is, if the couple finally managed to dig themselves out of debt. And, of course, if Dean doesn't wind up with a second divorce and child support payments for his and Tori's five children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tori Spelling Says Some Of The Plastic Surgery Rumors Are True</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnpmeYrqksMSrpKispGK7psCMsKarrJhir6ayzqucZqWRp7%2BqrcaeZK2nop56tLzEpaOippdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
