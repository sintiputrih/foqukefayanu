As it stands, Ross is currently one of the biggest streamers in the entire world. He is a part-owner in Kick, and he is their biggest draw. Right now, he lives out in Florida, which puts him in close proximity to Kodak. In fact, it seems like the two are very good friends. We know this because a couple of nights ago, Adin and Kodak went live on Instagram. It was here where Kodak threw out a warning to anyone who tries to cross Adin.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kodak-black-is-adin-s-biggest-fan>Kodak Black Is Adin's Biggest Fan</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Man, we gon’ cremate a n***a that’s fucking with Adin, boy! Yeah! I’ll cut a n***a dick off and put it in his mouth," Kodak said. Of course, this is a pretty brutal thing to say or do to someone. However, it just goes to show that Kodak is a big fan of Adin. He wants the kid to succeed, and in a dog eat dog world like streaming, Kodak is willing to go to bat for him. Whether or not Adin Ross feels the same about Yak, remains to be seen.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of the duo of Adin Ross and Kodak Black, in the comments section down below.
