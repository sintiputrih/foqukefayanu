According to sources, David Copperfield’s net worth is estimated to be $800 million, the majority of which he has accumulated from his appearances on television screens.</p><p>David Copperfield was born in 1956, in New Jersey, United States, where he studied at Metuchen High School. Copperfield’s interest in magic brought him to the “Society of American Magicians”, a fraternal magic organization, when he was only ten years old. As a result of his studies, Copperfield became proficient in magic, and even taught a course about magic at New York University at the age of 16. Upon his graduation from high school, David Copperfield decided to continue his education at Fordham University. He failed to graduate from the university, since instead of studying he chose to perform on stage. One of his very first performances was in “The Magic Man”. Around the same time, inspired by the Charles Dickens’ novel, he changed his name from David Seth Kotkin to David Copperfield. Soon after meeting Joseph Cates, who expressed interest in his talents, he made an appearance on television with “The Magic of ABC”,</p><p>In addition to having his own television specials, Copperfield made an acting debut in a slasher film, starring <a href=#>Ben Johnson</a>, <a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> and Hart Bochner called “Terror Train”. Since his popularity started growing, Copperfield has become a welcomed figure in the entertainment industry. Over the years, he has succeeded in selling more than 40 million tickets to his shows.</p><p>In regards to his personal life, David Copperfield married <a href=#>Claudia Schiffer</a> in 1993, yet the couple split up in 1999. Several years after their divorce, Copperfield met Chloe Gosselin, whom he married in 2006.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.546161321672><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$800 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 16, 1956</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Metuchen, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 11 in (1.82 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Magician, actor, illusionist</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Metuchen High School, New York University, Fordham University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Chloe Gosselin (2006–), Claudia Schiffer (1994–1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Sky Copperfield</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Rebecca Kotkin, Hyman Kotkin</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Partner</td><td>Chloe Gosselin, Chloe Gosselin</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>David Seth Kotkin , David Kotkin , Seth Kotkin</td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/davidcopperfield</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/D_Copperfield</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0004518</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Emmy Award for “Outstanding Technical Direction”, Hollywood Walk of Fame</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nominations</td><td>11 Guinness World Records, Living Legend by the US Library of Congress, “Magician of the Year” (1980, 1987)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>“Terror Train” (1980), "The Magic Of David Copperfield XVI: Unexplained Forces", "David Copperfield: Illusion" (1994)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>“The Magic of ABC”, “The Magic of David Copperfield IV: The Vanishing Plane”, “Project Magic”</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=3.8992125984252><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Each five-minute piece you now see in my show takes two years from idea to execution.

Site authors (a team of magicians, designers and engineers lead by Timur Abdulov) worked for more than 5 years, documenting and analyzing the illusions of Copperfield. The illusions revealed (in Russian and English) were dozens, minutely described and also accompanied by screenshots, images and some animation created by computer. Many of these illusions were never revealed before by anyone, remaining for years shrouded in mystery.

Finally, he would saw her in half inside a glass-sided box in what has sometimes been voted by other magicians as one of the most baffling versions of the sawing in half ever performed.
