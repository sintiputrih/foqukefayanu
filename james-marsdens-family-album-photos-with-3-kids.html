The pair expanded their family in August 2005 with the birth of daughter Mary James. Marsden and Linde called it quits in 2011 and <a href=#>the Notebook actor</a> moved on with Brazilian model <strong>Rose Costa</strong>.</p><p>The former <a href=#>Westworld</a> star found himself back on baby duty in December 2012 when his and Costa’s son, <a href=#>William Luca</a>, was born. His relationship with Costa, meanwhile, <a href=#>fizzled out before they welcomed their little one</a>.</p><p>“Once you become a father … it’s like riding a bike,” Marsden told ABC News of his shift back to parenting a baby. “Once you learn it, you sort of got it.”</p><p>However, the Hairspray actor joked that while his career in Hollywood is a pull for fans, his older kids don’t think much of it.</p><p>“Now that they are of age, it’s a little more fun for them,” Marsden told the outlet. “But they are still kind of wonderfully underwhelmed by what I do. I wouldn’t have it any other way. They think it’s cool but beyond that, I’m just still dad.”</p><p>Three years later, the <a href=#>27 Dresses</a> star’s son Jack saw firsthand what it was like being famous when he was his dad’s plus one for the <a href=#>2017 Screen Actor’s Guild Awards</a>. “My time’s over, my time’s done. I’m literally passing the baton on to the next,” <a href=#>Marsden said while walking the red carpet with his son</a>, who was 16 at the time, hinting that Jack wanted to be in showbiz.</p><p>The Critics Choice Awards winner noted that no matter what Jack decided to do for a career, he “doesn’t need much advice” from his father. “I actually go to him for advice,” Marsden told E! News. “He’s got his head on straight.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Party Down actor once again gushed over how wonderful his kids are while celebrating <a href=#>Father’s Day</a> with all three in June 2019. “My favorite holiday of the year celebrates what I am proud of most in life. Being a father,” <a href=#>he wrote via Instagram</a>. “To my Dad, to all the great Dads, who are with us now or were once lovingly with us, Happy Father’s day!”</p><p>Scroll down to see Marsden’s sweetest family moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt6K5xKxkppmiqLGmutJmnZqlmaHGbq3Lm6ymZaCdvLW70mauoqyYYoBut8idqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
