And since you can get more bang for your buck Down Under (there's a 12-hour red-eye from the West Coast and the currency conversion rate is in your favor), where better to tuck pandemic pain into the rear-view mirror by exploring, thrill-seeking, wining, and dining in royal fashion?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The South Island's charming resort town of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Queenstown</a> has proved popular during royal visits. Even the origin of the town's name <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>might be linked to Queen Victoria</a>, so naturally, it's at the top of our royalty-approved travel list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The late Queen Mother visited in 1966, while Queen Elizabeth headed down in 1970 (with the late Prince Philip, Prince Charles, and Princess Margaret) and again in 1990. But, it's the younger royals who have best explored the region's cinematic scenery, award-winning culinary scene, and adrenaline-pumping activities that give Queenstown its "adventure capital of the world" nickname.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lakes District Museum Arrowtown</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Snuggled up against Lake Wakatipu, the city (known as Tāhuna in Māori, the language of indigenous New Zealanders) was visited by William and Kate during their 2014 royal tour. The same year — more than a year before she met her future husband, Prince Harry — Meghan Markle also kicked off a 10-day South Island campervan trip in Queenstown after Suits co-star Gabriel Macht sold her on the idea.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This would be an ode to the road trips I took with my dad, the years of being a girl scout under the helm of my mom as troop leader, and my gravitational pull towards what is said to be one of the most beautiful countries in the world," she wrote on her now-defunct blog, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Tig</a>. "Turns out it really is."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, after two years of being dubbed "fortress New Zealand" as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern tightened borders amid Covid-19, the floodgates are opening, and what was already a popular destination, thanks to films like Lord of the Rings, is soaring up travelers' post-pandemic wishlists.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I revisited <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Meghan's old blog</a>, scoured photo archives, and visited local tourism operators while creating a dream Queenstown itinerary. And, whether it's sampling pinot like princes or floating around dazzling lakes like the Queen, not all regal adventures require a royal budget!</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they wined:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On their official trip, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge loved wine tasting (the 2011 RKV Reserve Pinot Noir was a favorite) at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Amisfield</a> — a celeb hotspot where Reese Witherspoon hung out while filming A Wrinkle in Time. After the royal couple learned it had been a tough growing season, which required helicopters flying above vines to circulate air, former search-and-rescue pilot William <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>reportedly chuckled</a>, "Well, if you ever need a spare pilot."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Word is that after hearing about the region's winemaking history, Prince William <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>exclaimed</a>, "We should probably stop the talking and start the drinking." Our kind of prince!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate, on the other hand, was eager to pick grapes at the merino station-turned-vineyard, which overlooks the picturesque Lake Hayes and features a rustic bistro. "I explained how we pick by hand to manage the quality better," said Amisfield co-owner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>John Darby</a>. "She was keen to come back and pick some other time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While princesses may have a rigid schedule, I made a day of it by heading to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kinross</a>, which is also the cellar door for other local boutique wineries, then wandered through <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Gibbston Valley's</a> enchanting wine cave — fun fact: The Bachelorette NZ once filmed a date here. The property also has a cheesery, concert venue, spa, and restaurant offering a new sharing-style set menu with options like melt-in-your-mouth baked flounder or slow-cooked lamb shoulder, all served with matching wine. Too boozed to leave? Check into the lodge, rent a cute villa overlooking the vines or if you want to be really extra, invest in a Gibbston Valley Resort property. If, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>like the Queen, you prefer gin</a>, head to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Cardrona Distillery</a> to sample The Source Gin and wrap up with sweet delight, Rose Rabbit Elderflower Liqueur.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they dined:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meghan Markle deemed lakeside dining spot <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Botswana Butchery Queenstown</a> a "standout" when she visited. Try sumptuous high-country lamb and Peking duck in the cozy surrounds of Archer's Cottage, which was beautifully transformed into the eatery in 2008. After a dreamy dessert of Botswana Wildflower Honey Crème Brulée, grab a Marshmallow Monk cocktail (marshmallow-infused vodka, yellow chartreuse, Aperol, lime juice, and ruby red grapefruit juice) and wander upstairs for a peek into bedrooms-turned-dining-suites and the lavish Upstairs Bar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For dinner with a majestic aerial view, ride the Skyline Queenstown Gondola 1476 feet up to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Stratosphere Restaurant and Bar</a>, where you'll feel like you're living in a postcard, all while enjoying a spread fit for the fussiest royal. The gondola and buffet dinner costs $68, but an extra $14 will score you three rides down what might be the world's most scenic luge course, one which even my mother cautiously braved – and loved. If it's a casual bite you're craving, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Fergburger</a> counts senior royals among its customers, as well as celebs like Reese Witherspoon and Justin Bieber. Ed Sheeran even summoned the Fergburger team to Dunedin to make him "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>the best burger in the world."</a> Get the full Kiwi experience by checking out the delicious savory pies at neighboring Fergbakery.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lakes District Museum Arrowtown</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they slept:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">William and Kate may have stayed at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Matakauri Lodge's Owner's Cottage</a>, but you don't need five-figure amounts to enjoy stunning, lakeside sleep. I felt every bit as regal entering the two-bedroom penthouse at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Rees Hotel, Queenstown</a> (starting at $493/night), with its floor-to-ceiling views and a spacious patio. Or stay in bed and gaze out at serene waters from the upper-level suite, where smiling staff will deliver lavender-scented pillows at midnight. The hotel, which has hosted the King of Jordan, offers a city shuttle, but you can also arrive royally via a water taxi from their private jetty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Care to splurge? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sofitel Queenstown Hotel and Spa's Penthouse #10</a> (starting at around $3,060/night) has central attractions on its doorstep, but you won't want to leave this luxurious escape, with its fireplace, movie room, patio, and private hot tub overlooking Lake Wakatipu. The Left Bank Bistro has something for everyone (including special dietary requests), while the plush 1789 Lounge awaits with curated cocktails. And with Fergburger across the road, there's no more royal way to enjoy takeout burgers than under a chandelier!</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they explored:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meghan Markle was charmed by the lakes, mountains, and fjords of the South Island — particularly, the Franz Josef glacier. You can experience equally jaw-dropping scenes with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Altitude Tours' coach/cruise/heli tour</a> ($362 per adult for travel through September) of Fiordland's Milford Sound, dubbed "the eighth Wonder of the World" by Rudyard Kipling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From a glass-roof Mercedes van, flawless views of Lake Wakatipu backdropped by The Remarkables mountain range gradually gave way to luscious fields dotted with sheep. Following a Lord of the Rings filming location photo stop, it was back on the road where canopies of intertwining silver beech, rata, and totara trees welcomed us to Fiordland National Park.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, a two-hour voyage with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mitre Peak Cruises</a> included a look at the majestic Mitre Peak, seal-lined rocks, and Stirling Falls (legend has it, the water's touch makes you 10 years younger). Personally, I felt younger just frolicking under the waterfall's spray as the captain dangled the bow underneath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next, the air chariot, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Helicopter Line</a>, awaited for my scenic return flight. The company, which has been asked to fly Prince Harry twice (plans sadly changed), has also teamed up with The Rees Hotel to introduce a separate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>heli-crayfish dining package</a>, which I previewed by landing on the shores of Milford Sound, where our diver Fraser disappeared into the water while we sipped champagne. Fraser emerged with a glorious basket of crayfish before we flew to the next gorgeous stop: the surreal Tutoko Glacier. "This feels like another planet," my mother (and travel companion) marveled, while we crunched through untouched ice. As we soared over emerald lakes, waterfalls, and deer-spotted mountains en route back to Queenstown, the beauty of Fiordland was staggering. And the fun wasn't over: Rippon wine awaited us back at The Rees Hotel, where the chef prepared just-caught crayfish for dinner. Now that's a day fit for a Queen!</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they got their adrenaline pumping:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Queenstown's known for adrenaline-pumping activities (after all, this is where AJ Hackett invented <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>bungee-jumping</a>), and on their trip, Prince William and Kate Middleton were all for it. Security operations for their 2014 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Shotover Jet</a> ride began six months prior. "Prince William wanted to go as close to the rocks as possible," their jet driver, Wayne Paton, told us. "He said, 'I bet you can go closer Wayne!'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We sat in the couple's exact seats before darting through towering canyons, over roaring rapids, and past nail-bitingly close rock faces at 59 miles-per-hour along Kimiākau (Shotover River).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Justin Bieber, Ed Sheeran, Hugh Jackman, Jason Momoa, Nina Dobrev, and Lauren Dern also have enjoyed the ride ($86 for adults), which is owned by a local Māori tribe Ngāi Tahu. When Queen Elizabeth visited in 1990, she safely observed the sights from a bridge. However, there's a view better fit for a royal at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Onsen Hot Pools</a>, where one can soak in private cedar hot tubs ($102 for two adults) with wine while watching the jetboats race by. Tourism New Zealand ambassador <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Bryce Dallas Howard called Onsen a gorgeous spot</a> to "luxuriate in glacial water."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they cruised:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cruise like a royal with a captivating journey on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TSS Earnslaw</a>. The steamship once hosted a cocktail party cruise for the Queen, where a former deck-hand overheard Prince Philip's lengthy conversation with the skipper. "They would've been talking boats!" he dished. The ship cruises along Lake Wakatipu to Walter Peak High Country Farm, where a gourmet BBQ ($80 including the cruise) featuring Cardrona Merino lamb, Zamora sausages, and sticky-date pudding awaited. Make sure to snap a new profile pic at an idyllic waterfront garden fit for the grounds of Buckingham Palace.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lakes District Museum Arrowtown</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they strolled:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, and Princess Anne wandered through <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Queenstown Gardens</a>, where Prince Philip tried curling and Prince Charles greeted awe-struck locals. You can also grab a to-go coffee from Meghan-approved Vudu Café and stroll past pretty ponds, fairytale-like bridges, and flowers in every shade of pink.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they got their feet wet:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meghan loved fly-fishing in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Wanaka</a>, which she described as, "a gem of a town where you quickly settle in." However, these days the mom-of-two might opt for a slightly easier lake adventure, like with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Lakeland Wanaka's</a> aqua bikes ($19 for a two-seater). Ride around the picture-perfect lake (an hour from Queenstown) or simply pedal out, sit back and soak up serene mountain views. Then hit Wanaka's bustling waterfront for divine grilled aubergine or blue-cod tacos at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Federal Diner</a>, followed by Insta-worthy stops at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>#thatWanakaTree</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Rippon Vineyard</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year after Meghan's visit, Prince Harry swept into town, where he was rumored to have stayed at the luxury mountain lodge <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Minaret Station</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where they learned:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arrowtown (20 minutes from Queenstown), came alive when the Queen stopped by in 1990, visiting the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lakes District Museum and Gallery</a> ($6 for adults). Museum director David Clarke recalls asking Her Majesty to sign a photo display he'd made of the Queen Mother's 1966 visit. Seemingly puzzled about signing memorabilia, she instead opted to sign the guestbook – her signature mirroring her mother's. "Maybe they had the same nanny!" suggested David, showing us the two similar signature styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arrowtown is also popular with celebrities, given its proximity to the filming hub of Queenstown. "Benedict Cumberbatch was in for coffee the other day," a local said about the Power of the Dog star.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cute main strip felt like the kind of place you'd film a smalltown Christmas movie, but wander down the bank, and you'll find the remains of a Chinese gold-mining settlement from the 1800s. The areas surrounding Arrowtown were also once visited by Māori tribes, who hunted birds and extracted pounamu (jade or greenstone), a precious stone that's commonly carved into exquisite pendants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While they're the ultimate keepsake from any trip to Aotearoa (Māori for New Zealand), you can also hire gold-mining pans for $3 and try your luck at the river. After all, what better souvenir from a royal-inspired vacation than gold?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8yenqGZnmK6or7KpZxooJ%2BserW7jK2pmq6VoXqttcqeZK2glWK%2FsMXApapmoZ5ivraxxKeqraenow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
