I specially use the Vitamix A3500 Ascent Series, and you can get it for <strong>$150 off</strong> right now! It offers 120 volts of power, five program settings, and 10 different speed controls that you can control by the touchscreen or an app on your phone.

If you’d rather snag a colorful one (like my <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">yellow one</a>!), they’re $70 off, which is still a great deal. You can use this mixer to make everything from <a href=# rel=noopener>cookies</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>bread</a>, and if you like, you can even pair it with the nifty <a href=# rel=noopener>KitchenAid attachments</a> to make pasta, ice cream, and more.
