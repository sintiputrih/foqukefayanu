The story follows Elizabeth Zott, a brilliant chemist who is forced to leave her college programme and becomes a lab assistant. However, after fate hands her a cooking show, where she uses scientific explanations to explain how to cook some of her excellent dishes, she becomes a household name... and changes some lives.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e885168eaf60-lessonsofchemistryphoto010801.jpg><h3>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</h3><p id=e_lICe_BRq data-wc=3></p><p id=ej1kORr13h data-wc=92>Has one singer done more to empower millions of young women and girls over the years?

Enjoy!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a1af4961ce5c-c70a6b1e372f42075d46d3ee81789f4f4096x27305879616e.jpg><h3>Sex/Life</h3><p id=eN87wPEZed2L data-wc=7></p><p id=eZXEJIB3eTrQ data-wc=83>Season two of this <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>raunchy show recently landed on Netflix</a>&nbsp;</strong>and fans have delved into the new episodes. The premise of the story in both seasons of the drama is centred on Billie (Sarah Shahi) who is torn between her sexual desires with her ex-boyfriend and her relationship with her husband, but, ultimately, it's about a strong woman who decides to take control of what she wants. <strong>If you haven't watched yet, check out the video below for a teaser of season two…</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ejcXoNRWb6GC data-wc=77>The creator, Stacey Rukeyser, is clearly proud of the theme around Sex/Life. "If you want to see a morality tale about a woman with sexual desire, all you have to do is look at the entire canon of film and television," she told Variety, adding: "What usually happens is that a woman with sexual desire either goes crazy or becomes the bad girl. I was really adamant that that is not the story that we are telling."</p><h3>I Hate Suzie</h3><p id=eqN7ShYo9zN0 data-wc=5></p><p id=eT69kXZ9fUA3 data-wc=72>Another show with a strong female lead is starring Billie Piper. The show was so popular that it returned with a second season at the end of 2022, once again focusing on Billie's character Suzie Pickles, a celebrity who suffers a mild breakdown after her phone is hacked. Although Suzie has a love/hate relationship with the public and her followers, her humanness and witty one-liners make her thoroughly watchable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/434372e6109e-i-hate-suzie-too-z.jpg><h3>Back to Life</h3><p id=eQxicTdclmDk data-wc=5></p><p id=eBtgmfsu01x3 data-wc=75>Season two of may have aired in 2021 but thanks to its new home on Netflix, it's drawing a new audience. The dark comedy tells the story of Miri Matteson (Daisy Haggard) a woman who has recently been released from prison after 18 years and is struggling to come to terms with her new normal. Similar to a flawed but real (and hilarious) central female character makes this unmissable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/59ed4eea84d7-back-to-life-z.jpg><h3>Women Who Rock</h3><p id=e3JaMPT07icJ data-wc=6></p><p id=eeoy65-qCCFq data-wc=75>Fiction aside, maybe you're keen to learn about real women in history who have made a difference. In this case, this music documentary is a great option. The four-part docuseries focuses on female pioneers in music who have become icons and legends in their own right. It features interviews and archive footage of huge names like Janis Joplin, Chaka Khan, Shania Twain, and more as they discuss their experience in an industry dominated by men.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bee152f0a390-chaka-khan-women-who-rock-z.jpg><h3>Hidden Figures</h3><p id=eDNhgb2vwQaM data-wc=5></p><p id=eKLyGNw78Obw data-wc=85>Another one for history fans is . It might be a movie, but the plot is real and important. The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae as three African-American women who played a pivotal role during the Space Race at NASA in the 1960s. At a time when America was segregated by both sex and race, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan's stories were not heard by the masses. This title brings to light a fundamental and inspiring story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/993d4215caf8-hidden-figures-movie-z.jpg><h3>Motherland</h3><p id=eFShqZ-dGnv2 data-wc=6></p><p id=e2i2AindqiAW data-wc=91>We never get tired of watching . The BBC comedy depicts motherhood so brilliantly and hilariously, but it also strikes an emotional nerve, too. It centres on Julia and her gang of friends including the larger-than-life Meg, outcast Liz, alpha female Amanda and, of course, the hapless dad, Kevin. They all battle the everyday burden of being a parent and trying to hold down a job, remain active and keep up their social lives, all the while batting off inconveniences from aging in-laws. It's one of the best comedies there is.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/50651de4d68b-motherland-series-3-z.jpg><p id=eP1e6AeVqmcm style=font-size:12px data-wc=42><a class=hm-link href=#>FAQ page</a>.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
