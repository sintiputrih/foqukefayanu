Some people think that she didn't deserve the coveted spot. She was competing with Miss Mexico Sofía Montserrat Aragón Torres apart from Africa's Tunzi.</p><p>Her outfits were absolutely stunning, especially the hibiscus inspired costume she wore during the National costume round. Gorgeous didn't even begin to cover the look, complete with green thigh-high boots and headgear.&nbsp;</p><p>Anderson consistently came through all the rounds, answering Steve Harvey's questions confidently, but viewers think there were more deserving candidates than Anderson. "To be honest I’m really disappointed about the final decision. At least Mexico should be named 1sr runner up. Let’s be honest, Puerto Rico has a big lack on her answers," said one user, while another agreed, saying, "As I reflect over the competition, I’m still trying to understand how Miss Puerto Rico got so far." A third one took a jab at her closing statement, "Puerto Rico dint deserve that crown. Her answers were shallow ffs"</p><p>In her closing statement, Anderson had said, "Being on the stage of Miss Universe is not just a dream. I believe that I found my mission. It's a representation of dedication, resilience, and perseverance. I truly believe that my mission is to show the world that magic happens when we refuse to give up because the universe always listens to a stubborn heart."&nbsp;</p><p>But Anderson's passion and grace did win over many. "Miss Puerto Rico didn't win, but the world heard Puerto Rico said multiple times, tonight. May this lead more people focus on the ongoing needs of the island," said a user, adding, "Miss Puerto Rico used the words "resilience, & perseverance" in her closing statement. That describes the island. So poignant." Her fans rooted for the pageant queen, whose answers won hearts.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZmowG7BzaKtnqqjmnpzfJByZKaho6h6scHEq6uoZaKesLB5zJqboqufo3qiusOeqaynnmLBsLyMbGSdp52Wtq%2BrlWapnpmTqbawuoysn5qknKTEbq3NrK6eqqNiuqbEyJym</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
