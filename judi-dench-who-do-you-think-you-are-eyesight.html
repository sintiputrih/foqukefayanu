"Studies show that taking nutritional supplements such as Vitamin C & E, Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Zinc & Copper may help," she tells HELLO!. "Also, lifestyle changes such as dieting, exercising, avoiding smoking and protecting eyes from UV rays may help as well."</p><p id=ewYHIk9-SAJp data-wc=10><strong>Here's everything else there is to know about the condition.</strong></p><h2><strong>What is macular degeneration?</strong></h2><p id=e2eQVP-LBTu0 data-wc=74>"Age-Related Macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that affects one’s central vision where their sharpest vision occurs, causing vision loss," Dr Nish explains. "This is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. There are two forms of AMD - Dry and Wet. The dry form involves the accumulation of drusen (i.e waste of the eye) in one's macula, while the wet form involves abnormal blood vessel growth & fluid build-up."</p><h2><strong>At what age might you get age-related macular degeneration?</strong></h2><p id=et-o81VqQW3s data-wc=25>"Age-related macular degeneration may be found as early as age 55," says Dr Nish. Dame Judi Dench was diagnosed when she was 77 years old.</p><h2><strong>Age-related macular degeneration symptoms</strong></h2><p id=e7Iorhr-pj4Y data-wc=50>"Most of the time, AMD can be diagnosed before symptoms arise by an eye doctor," Dr Nish says. "In the later stage of AMD, symptoms may include blurry or fuzzy vision, the appearance of straight lines/objects being wavy, and/or grey, dark or empty areas in the centre of one's vision."</p><h2><strong>Treatment for age-related macular degeneration</strong></h2><p id=eT1avPnVgkC8 data-wc=77>"Unfortunately, Macular Degeneration is considered an incurable eye disease," Dr Nish tells us. "However, studies show that taking nutritional supplements such as Vitamin C & E, Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Zinc & Copper may slow the progression. Also, lifestyle changes such as dieting, exercising, avoiding smoking and protecting eyes from UV rays may help as well. For Wet AMD, medications called anti-VEGF drugs can reduce the abnormal blood vessels, bleeding & swelling but cannot repair any previous vision loss."</p><p id=eTtd-kkvW8F2 data-wc=11><strong>Subscribe to <a class=hm-link href=#>Hello Happiness,</a> for your ultimate guide on how to be happier.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45rZ2trYGh9eH2Vb2htcF%2BfwqW1jJ2cp5uYYsSpu4ydpmaxn6p6tbTIp6JmsZ%2BqeqK%2BxGacsp2jnrSpwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
