Corina has been a famous name in the industry for quite some time and has even made some wild headlines in the past. She also had dating rumors with Bronny James’ good friend Adin Ross. So now when she’s tried to get something with the Young King fans aren’t liking it. As the future star just turned 18.</p><p>Bronny James has already got himself a good name, fame and game. He also recently signed a NIL deal with Nike and is following in his father, LeBron James’ footsteps. Right now he isn’t projected to be a top pick and isn’t that highly ranked. But he has a lot of time and is really putting that hard work in to get better. And, everyone around can already see the improvements he’s making.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>So there’s no doubt about him making it to the league. And, once Bronny is in, he and LeBron James will become the first father-son duo of the league. Bron will also have his dream coming true. As then he can share the court with his son and probably both will be wearing the same jersey. But for that to happen the young King has to stay on track and keep getting the job done.</p><p>Bronny has already been on the receiving end of some controversial headlines. And, the most recent one could have been with Corina Kopf, but he was smart and got himself out swiftly as the model tried to flirt with him. They met on Adin Ross’ live stream recently and started their interaction with a side hug while Corina was scared of her butt coming out due to the dress she was wearing or maybe she was just trying to be funny.</p><p>Further, Adin and Bronny had a chat about Corina moving on from Adin and it was interrupted by the model as she questioned: “How was your birthday party?… You had all fun… Travis Scott was there?” to Bronny. The Young King gave her a normal reply and said “It was cool.”</p><p>Just like fans, even Adin Ross wasn’t liking this as he called out Corina and said: “Yeah, why you looking at him like that?” And, as expected Corina had her reasons. As she stated: “He’s like tall now and the voice is deep and stuff.” Bronny though claimed to never met her but Corina had a totally different story which later turned out to be true. As she said: “Yes, I have” in response to Bronny’s “You have never met me.” Then she went on to tell how Adin and all his friends including LeBron James’ eldest son visited her place once last year.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>“I take full accountability and responsibility for my actions” Kyrie Irving apologizes to the Jewish community after the Nets suspend him</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans react to Corina Kopf flirting with Bronny James</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Adobe_Express_20220816_1527330_1-1024x576.jpg><p>The viral video of Corina Kopf’s interaction with Bronny where she tried to flirt with him is all over the internet.
