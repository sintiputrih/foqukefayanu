relationship after becoming the<a href=#> fan-favorite couple of Bachelor in Paradise.&nbsp;</a></p><p>A follower wanted to know how often the two see each other, and Serene answered, “Everyday,”

argument/disagreement yet?”</p><p>Brandon and Serene were never shown arguing or having many conflicts while on Bachelor in Paradise, but they admitted they have fought since being in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>Brandon teased that one of the things they fight about is how Serene still has stock photos in their picture frames.&nbsp;</p><img

expressed fighting “like every normal couple.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fights and all, Brandon and Serene remain one of The Bachelor franchise’s favorite couples.&nbsp;</p><p>Bachelor in Paradise is currently on
