At the time, Renee was an aspiring actress while Matthew was already a part of </span><i><span>Glee</span></i><span> for over 2 years. However, it wasn’t Renee’s Filipino looks that attracted Matthew to her. Rather, during the party, the former </span><i><span>So You Think You Can Dance</span></i><span> judge heard Renee speaking pidgin (Hawaiian slang), and was immediately intrigued by her.</span></p><p><span>“I sang backup for a guy named Don Ho in high school and spent summers in Hawaii. So when I heard her speak, I said, ‘How is it, sistah?’ and she laughed. The rest is history,” Matthew explained.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to June 2013, the lovebirds then got engaged and announced the good news at “White Tie and Tierra Ball” in London on June 27.

And because of the choices she made — “keeping her children in dangerous environments until the day she died” — Renee had to bury her baby brothers.</span></p><p><span>However, Renee has no hatred toward her mother. She’s long forgiven her and instead, she thanks her mother for the life she’s given to her.</span></p><p><span>On mother’s day 2017, Renee even shared a few pics of her mother, captioned, “Happiest of Mothers Days to all the super women out there who grew life in her womb… I can’t thank you enough, Brenda, for being my mom.. my one and only… I love you more than all the ✨in the sky…”</span></p><p><span>As for Renee’s father, he was alive and doing well as of 2022. She described him to be a “courageous, loving, childlike human being” who was her “peer, best friend, and confidant.”</span></p><p><span>Talking about Renee’s siblings, they are Lorraine Bruce, Brian Lando, and Valentine Lang.
