He was 80.</p><p>His death was confirmed in a statement from his family distributed Thursday by the Bears.</p><p>“The Butkus family confirms that football and entertainment legend Dick Butkus died peacefully in his sleep overnight at home in Malibu, California,” the statement on X read. “The Butkus family is gathering with Dick’s wife Helen. They appreciate your prayers and support.”</p><p>A two-time All-American at the University of Illinois, Butkus, a Chicago native, was an eight-time Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro in the NFL and is widely regarded as one of the greatest linebackers in the history of the game and having helped revolutionize the position.</p><p>“Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,” Bears chairman George McCaskey said in a statement.</p><p>“He was Chicago’s son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidentally, what George Halas looked for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership. He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. When we dedicated the George Halas statue at our team headquarters, we asked Dick to speak at the ceremony, because we knew he spoke for Papa Bear.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Linebacker Dick Butkus #51 of the Chicago Bears in action against the Pittsburgh Steelers during an NFL football game September 19, 1971. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Dick Butkus, former Illinois and Chicago Bears linebacker, waves during a timeout as the first inductee of the Illinois Athletics Hall of Fame. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“Dick had a gruff manner, and maybe that kept some people from approaching him, but he actually had a soft touch. His legacy of philanthropy included a mission of riding performance enhancing drugs from sports and promoting heart health. His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans.”</p><p>Despite being limited to nine seasons due to knee issues, his 27 fumble recoveries remain a Bears franchise record.</p><p>“Dick Butkus was a fierce and passionate competitor who helped define the linebacker position as one of the NFL’s all-time greats,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “Dick’s intuition, toughness and athleticism made him the model linebacker whose name will forever be linked to the position and the Chicago Bears.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Linebacker Dick Butkus #51 of the Chicago Bears, on the sidelines during a 1971 season game. <span class=credit>Diamond Images/Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Dick Butkus (51), Doug Buffone (55) and Joe Taylor (20) stop Detroit Lions running back Steve Owens (36) during an NFL football game Nov. 21, 1971. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>A two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, and his iconic No. 51 was retired in 1994.</p><p>If it seems odd that Butkus’ number took so long to be retired by the Bears given his playing career ended in 1973, it could probably be explained by his rift with the organization.</p><p>His career-ending knee injury occurred with four years remaining on his contract, at a rate of $115,000 year, that was guaranteed for injury.</p><p>He sued the team, and the lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, but the Chicago Tribune reported in 2012 that Butkus and George Halas went five years without speaking to each other.</p><p>“It was like I had leprosy,” Butkus said. “They were spreading rumors I wouldn’t play because of my pain tolerance.”</p><p>The feud ended in 1979, when Butkus asked Halas to sign a copy of his own autobiography, and Halas wrote, “To: Dick Butkus. The greatest player in the history of the Bears. You had that old zipperoo.”</p><p>Butkus had an extensive post-playing career as an actor, appearing in a number of films and TV shows including “The Longest Yard,” “Murder, She Wrote” and “MacGyver.”</p><p>He was also a pitchman for various products, including appearances in some of the classic “Great Taste / Less Filling” Miller Lite advertisements, and at one point worked as an NFL studio analyst for CBS Sports.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">general view during a moment of remembrance for former Chicago Bears Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus at FedExField on Oct. 5, 2023. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Former Chicago Bear Dick Butkus is seen on the sideline during the game between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field on Sept. 10, 2023. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Butkus is survived by his wife, Helen, his high school sweetheart who he married in 1963, and three adult children: Ricky, Matt, and Nikki.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmaW1fmLWqr8CgpmaalZa%2FtHnLnp6eppRisaqvymaZrqybqsBusMSam2aZpGKFcXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
