He was a four-time Oscar nominee with iconic movies like “Aladdin,” “Mrs. Doubtfire,” Jumanji,” and “Good Will Hunting,” to his credit.&nbsp;</p><p>His talent in acting was such that he always left his audience feeling moved. It won him many fans and accolades, but in the end, all that love was not enough to protect him.&nbsp;Robin passed away from suicide on August 11, 2014, at 63, after struggling with what his spouse called a “terrorist” in his body.&nbsp;</p><p>He left devastated fans, saddened friends, a mournful widow, and two former wives behind. Here is what we know about Robin Williams’ spouses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/robwill.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Times_Was_Robin_Williams_Married></span>How Many Times Was Robin Williams Married?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robin Williams was married three times in his lifetime. The first woman he married was Valerie Velardi, and after her, he moved in with Marsha Garces.&nbsp;</p><p>His last wedding was to a woman named Susan Schneider, and she has been working hard to ensure nobody endures the pain she had to after her husband died from a disease people barely know about.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Robin_Williams_First_Spouse></span>Robin Williams’ First Spouse&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robin’s first wife was Valerie Velardi. The pair met in 1976 before he became famous. He was a bartender in San Francisco then, and he started a conversation with her one day, to which she responded warmly.&nbsp;</p><p>They ultimately married in June 1978 and welcomed their first child, son Zachary “Zak” Williams, in 1983.&nbsp;The union suffered due to Robin’s unfaithfulness, which he publicly admitted later. Velardi knew his love for women, but she could not stand his time away from home.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/velar-fotor-20230822175140.jpg><p>In the 2018 documentary “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,” she said, “He loved women. Absolutely loved women. And I got it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Velardi added: “I understood, and I wanted him to have that, but I also wanted him to come home.” She and Robin got divorced in 1988. However, they continued to co-parent their son.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marsha_Garces_Was_Robin_Williams_Second_Wife></span>Marsha Garces Was Robin Williams’ Second Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Garces was Robin Williams’ second spouse. The film producer and philanthropist met him in 1984 when she was a nanny to Robin’s son Zak.&nbsp;Some reports claim Garces and Robin’s relationship started while he was still married. However, Velardi clarified in the 2018 documentary that it began after her separation from Robin.&nbsp;</p><p>Garces and Robin ultimately got married on April 30, 1989. At the time, she was six months pregnant with their first child.&nbsp;They welcomed their daughter, Zelda Rae Williams, later that year, and in 1991 the couple expanded their family by welcoming a second child, Cody Alan Williams.&nbsp;</p><p>Marsha Garces did some work with Robin as his assistant on some of his movies, including “Good Morning,” “Vietnam,” and “Dead Poets Society.”&nbsp;She was also the producer for some, including “Mrs. Doubtfire,” “Patch Adams,” and “Jakob the Liar.”&nbsp;</p><p>They eventually formed a production company together called Blue Wolf Productions. Garces filed for divorce in March 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized two years later.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Susan_Schneider_Robin_Williams_Third_Wife_She_Saw_Him_in_a_Different_Light></span>Who Is Susan Schneider, Robin Williams’ Third Wife? She Saw Him in a Different Light<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The last woman Robin married was Susan Schneider. They married on October 22, 2011, in St. Helena, California, after meeting at an Apple Store in 2007.&nbsp;Schneider loved Robin deeply, but what she fell in love with was not the charismatic funnyman we all knew and loved.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/susssn-fotor-20230822174851.jpg><p>According to Schneider, she would not have married Robin if all he was, even behind closed doors, was a comedian.&nbsp;Indeed, things were different when Robin was not on set or among people he wanted to make happy. She described him as an intellectual and quiet person who was always contemplating.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a>: “The man at home, my husband, was quiet, contemplative, an intellectual. The standup and acting that was his work.”&nbsp;</p><p>When the actor passed in in 2014, Schneider was torn apart. She posted an emotional message about Robin’s passing that revealed her raw emotions.&nbsp;</p><p>She wrote: “This morning, I lost my husband and best friend while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Schneider has been candid about Robin’s struggles since his demise. In the 2020 documentary “Robin’s Wish,” she said, “Robin’s suicide was a consequence of brain disease; his brain was compromised. I look at it like Robin wanted to end the disease – he just didn’t realize that meant he would end, too.”&nbsp;</p><p>Schneider still misses <a href=#>Robin Williams</a>, and so do his fans and every other soul he ever touched. All that remains of him is his extensive legacy, through which he lives on.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kv7CuyKdksKGcobaiudJmqqmnpaiybr%2FHnmSsmamoerW0xGadrqaerrqiuoywmKxllJ6zp7HRnqWtZZGpeqm7zJ5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
