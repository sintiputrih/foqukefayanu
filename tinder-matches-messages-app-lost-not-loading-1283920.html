Tinder recommends users try logging out and then back into their accounts to get their matches back, they can do this by selecting "settings" and then "logout."</p><p>Users should note though that if only one or two matches disappeared it's most likely because the other user they matched with either deleted their account or unmatched them.</p><p>Tinder did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment.</p><p>This is a developing story and will be updated when more information becomes available.</p><span><i class=uncommon-logo></i></span><h2>Uncommon Knowledge</h2><p class=subtitle-desktop>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p class=subtitle-mobile>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p>");jQuery(this).remove()}) jQuery('.start-slider').owlCarousel({loop:!1,margin:10,nav:!0,items:1}).on('changed.owl.carousel',function(event){var currentItem=event.item.index;var totalItems=event.item.count;if(currentItem===0){jQuery('.owl-prev').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-prev').removeClass('disabled')} if(currentItem===totalItems-1){jQuery('.owl-next').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-next').removeClass('disabled')}})}})})<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrK6enZtjsLC5jq2gp5yVp3qurdOcn56rXaKytL%2FAoJysZZGlvW64zqyrZqafqXqtu8CdoKefXWZ%2FeX%2BYa2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
