The one worker states that she doesn't think that she's ever had it, as the she and her co-worker look at the pictures he's attempting to get printed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @infrabren</span></figure><p>He adds that he's "dipping" his "feet into the world of pistachio pudding" while adding that there aren't a lot of brands that make it. The first picture he's attempting to get printed then pops up on the screen: it's a picture of the exterior of the copy store, with text that reads: "NO GUARD OUT FRONT"</p><p>The next picture is a zoomed in photo on the business' front door which reads: "CHEAP DOOR. BREAKABLE GLASS"</p><p>The woman working at the store stares ahead at the screen seemingly unsure of how to process the information in front of her.</p><p>Another photo shows up on the screen, and things just keep getting more and more suspicious: "Kwikset 660 Model Lock... Pickable" the text reads.</p><p>She seems more and more uncomfortable the longer she looks at the screen before her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @infrabren</span></figure><p>He continues to joke about pistachio pudding along with getting himself some "start up money."</p><p>Another photo comes up on the screen highlighting more security details of the business that makes it look more and more as if he's casing the joint: "One Security Camera, Upper Right of Entrance," he rights, zooming in on the security camera in question.</p><p>"Lot's Usually Empty" another text box reads on yet another photo of the exterior of the business states.</p><p>"Restaurant next door... might be problem," another photo reads. The employee finally makes a comment about the pictures he's attempting to print out at the copy shop.</p><p>"You can see those?" he asks, suspiciously.</p><p>"Yeah," she responds. He begins to chuckle before she calls over another worker named Amber, who also looks at the screen concerned.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @infrabren</span></figure><p>"I just need one of each...on their own paper," the man says aloud.</p><p>Amber takes a beat before finally looking up towards the TikToker and asks, "What is this for?"</p><p>"I just need to hand them out to the crew. You know?" he tells the employee.</p><p>"Who's your crew?" she asks.</p><p>"Good group of guys. Best guys you'll ever meet. No big deal. It's not really a big deal," he tells the workers as he chuckles again.</p><p>Commenters who saw Infrabren's post commended him on his ability to play the gag straight, while also making the clip extremely difficult to watch: "This is such a hard watch, well done"</p><p>"She looked terrified from the jump," another person said.</p><p>"social anxiety fears him," someone else remarked.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @infrabren</span></figure><p>There was one user on the app, however who joked that Infrabren was performing a valuable service for local businesses: "Bren is single handedly hardening security at local establishments"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMK0vMicoKito2LBqbXNoKpmqKKeu7Wxw2aYrWWTpL26edKtpqud</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
