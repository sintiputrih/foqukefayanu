And I also had a wife of mine, we’ve been married now 39 years, who told me, ‘If you take a job back with the WWE, I’m gonna divorce your ass.”</p><p>The saying on Tony Schiavone’s What Happened When podcast is: “Lois Rules.” They even sell it on a Hulk Hogan parody t-shirt. Apparently, Lois had the right idea in this instance, because it caused Tony Schiavone to take a deal with AEW, one he is very happy about.</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49qZmlvX6m8r8WMrJqhoZGrvK%2Bx0mauop6VYsGpvsSaq56mlZl6tbuMnaCvp6KYsm60yKZkop5dnbJuw8Snq2aakZi4bsDOZq6wnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
