It will be a major understatement to categorize bodybuilding as a sport or hobby.</p><p>In actuality, bodybuilding is a way of life. For us to demonstrate to you that bodybuilding can be financially rewarding if you are prepared to work hard, today we’re taking a look at the top 20 richest bodybuilders in the world.</p><p>Regular bodybuilding life is not glamorous or thrilling. You must make numerous sacrifices and spend a substantial sum of money. You&nbsp;have gym subscriptions, exercise equipment, shakers, wraps, straps, gym bags, and so forth to start. Of course, you still need to buy your supplements.</p><p>You may easily spend up to $200 per month on supplements alone, and building a supplement stack is not inexpensive. The cost of all the food you must buy, however, is by far the biggest financial outlay.</p><p>It is a must to consume a lot of protein and high-quality foods in order to gain muscle. Even though it is very expensive, if you think of it as an investment in your own future, it will be worthwhile.</p><p>I don’t always believe that bodybuilders are given the credit they merit. Most sportsmen, singers, and actors are paid well. The top paid people in these categories should be worth between $100 million and $1 billion, according to expectations.</p><p>It’s definitely not the same when it comes to bodybuilders. The Top 10 richest bodybuilders in the world have been identified along with their current net worth.</p><p>Before reading on, can you make a guess as to who will be included on this list of the richest bodybuilders?</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Top 10 Richest Athletes in the World (2022)</a></strong></p><h2>10 Richest Bodybuilders in The World and Their Net Worth</h2><p>The table below shows the ranking order of the richest bodybuilders in the world, their net worth, weight, and country.</p><table style=height:677px width=803><tbody><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Ranking</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Names</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Net Worth</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Weight</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Country</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>1</span></td><td><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Arnold Schwarzenegger</span></a></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$400 million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>235 lb (107 kg)</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Austria-America</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>2</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Rich Gaspari</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$90 Million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>245 – 255lbs (111.1 – 115.7kg)</span></td><td>Canada</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>3</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Jay Cutler&nbsp;</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$30 Million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>260 lb (118 kg)</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>America</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>4</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Lou Ferrigno</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$12 million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>285 – 295lbs (129.3kg – 133.8kg)</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>America</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>5</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Ronnie Coleman</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$10 Million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>287–300 lb (130–136 kg)</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>America</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>6</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Gary Strydom</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$8 million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>283 lb (128 kg)</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>America</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>7</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Phil Heath</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$8 Million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>240 lb (109 kg)</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>America</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>8</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Lee Haney</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$5.5 Million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>255 lb (116 kg)</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>America</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>9</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Dorian Yates</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$4 million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>260–265 lb (118–120 kg)</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>United Kingdom</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>10</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Dexter Jackson</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$2 million</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>215 lb (98 kg)&nbsp;</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>America</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>1.
