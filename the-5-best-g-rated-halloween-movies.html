Without further ado, let’s count down the best G-rated Halloween movies, ranked from worst to best.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Halloweentown</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Not every Disney Channel original movie is a hit but it’s safe to say 1998’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloweentown</a> veers more in the territory of classics than others. Think of it as a precursor to Harry Potter in some ways, in which our main 13-year-old character, Kimberly J. Brown’s Marnie Piper, discovers she is a witch and is transported to a magical place called Halloweentown, the home of supernatural beings, such as werewolves, goblins, vampires, and other ghouls. Soon, Marnie must battle evil warlocks in order to save the realm.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=882 data-injectable=true>Originally released in theaters in 1949, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad</a> is a two-for-one anthology that features an adaptation of the children’s novel The Wind in the Willows and the Halloween classic short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Each story is an enjoyable ride that could be considered excellent viewing for the spooky season, with Ichabod’s tale, in particular, representing what many consider to be the definitive version of the story. A headless horseman who terrorizes a sleepy New England village? You can’t get more Halloween than that.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Secret of NIMH</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>The Secret of NIMH may not technically be a straight-up Halloween movie. However, with its themes of magic, creepy imagery, and a titillating story about a young mouse’s struggle to save her family, the G-rated film is sure to be a hit in any kid-friendly movie marathon this spooky season. The widowed Mrs. Brisby must save her bedridden son stricken with pneumonia before the farmer’s plow threatens to upend her home.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>With the help of super-intelligent rats, a magical amulet, and a prophetic owl who gratefully isn’t interested in eating the rodent, she has all the tools she needs to save the day. Though the film can be a little scary for extremely young or sensitive viewers, it is a beautifully realized all-time animated classic that any fan of the fantasy genre owes to themselves to watch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>In this stop-motion animated classic from the creators of Chicken Run, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</a> features plenty of pumpkins, spooky transformations, full moons, and jaw-dropping creatures to satisfy any Halloween fanatic. In a mystery story centering on a cursed Were-Rabbit that is ravaging local gardens, the pest-control agent protagonists are faced with the terrifying challenge of controlling a supernatural beast. The film does a great job of making a pile of ravaged vegetables feel like a gruesome crime scene in a story that is atmospheric but not too scary for younger viewers.</p><h2 id=h-monsters-inc data-injectable=false>Monsters, Inc.</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>If you’re looking for a movie about monsters who are tasked with scaring children, and yet, isn’t scary at all, Monsters, Inc. is the perfect choice for you. The purple furry Sully and one-eyed Mike, played by John Goodman and Billy Crystal respectively, are more cuddly than truly terrifying. And yet, the film offers a huge array of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">imaginative creatures</a> throughout.</p><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=false>Offering a cute adventure about a little girl who discovers an alternate realm where these monsters live, work, and play, Monsters, Inc. is truly more of an adventure movie than a horror film. At the same time, the film can be considered a celebration of the spooky season due to the fantastical beings at its center and a heavy dose of nostalgic themes of childhood, such as having imaginary friends and the warm feeling of a parent reassuring their kid that there’s nothing harmful hiding underneath the bed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGZtXZeytMCMoGSrmaSasW60wKWjqK%2BVmrtuuc6voJ6rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
