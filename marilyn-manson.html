Manson and his namesake band, discovered by Nine Inch Nails vocalist Trent Reznor, released goth albums such as Antichrist Superstar and Smells Like Children, much to the delight of troubled teenagers and much to the anger of their parents.</p><h2><span id=Childhood>Childhood</span></h2><p>Hugh and Barb Warner gave birth to Manson on January 5, 1969, in Canton, Ohio. Warner had a difficult upbringing because he was assaulted multiple times by a neighbor. The trauma drove the young child to rebel as he attempted to reconcile the events with his daily life.</p><p>Manson and his family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after high school for his father’s profession. The young Manson enrolled at Broward Community College, a local community college, where he studied journalism and drama. Warner’s initial journey into the music industry was as an entertainment columnist for a local Fort Lauderdale magazine. This allowed him the opportunity to interview several well-known musicians, including Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.</p><p>Warner founded a band called Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids while working as a journalist. Manson has revealed that the name for his alter identity was created by combining Marilyn Monroe’s first name with Charles Manson’s surname name. Later, the band’s name was changed to simply Marilyn Manson.</p><h2><span id=8216Portrait_of_an_American_Family8217_8216Smells_Like_Children8217_and_other_albums_and_songs>‘Portrait of an American Family,’ ‘Smells Like Children,’ and other albums and songs</span></h2><p>Based on their performances and self-released cassettes in the Fort Lauderdale region, Marilyn Manson and his band were signed to Trent Reznor’s record company, Nothing, in 1993. They also got a spot on Nine Inch Nails’ 1994 tour as a result of the album deal. Portrait of an American Family was the title of Marilyn Manson’s first album. It was produced by Reznor and provided Manson his first taste of commercial success, as he established a cult following its release.</p><p>Marilyn Manson’s 1995 EP Smells Like Children featured a cover of the Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of These),” which received extensive airplay on MTV. This cover eventually helped Smells Like Children achieve platinum status.</p><p>‘Antichrist Superstar,’ ‘Mechanical Animals,’ and ‘Holy Wood,’ to name a few.</p><p>Marilyn Manson made a name for herself with the release of the group’s second album, Antichrist Superstar, in 1996. Reznor co-produced the album, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. The next year, he released Remix & Repent, his second EP.</p><p>With the release of Mechanical Animals in 1998, Marilyn Manson attained his biggest success. The record debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, propelling ticket sales for his Last Tour on Earth, which began a year later. For the record and tour, Manson assumed the glam rocker identity of Omega, an androgynous space extraterrestrial.</p><p>Marilyn Manson released Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) in 2000 and went on tour the following year in promotion of the album. During a performance in Michigan, a security guard accused him of sexual misconduct for allegedly executing an offensive act. Later in the tour, he was served with a civil action stating that Manson rubbed his pelvis on the head of a security guard. The accusation of misbehavior was ultimately reduced to a misdemeanor, and the civil complaint was abandoned.</p><p>‘The Golden Age of Grotesque,’ ‘Eat Me, Drink Me,’ and ‘The High End of Low’ are just a few examples.</p><p>Marilyn Manson and his band released The Golden Age of Grotesque, their fifth studio album, in 2003. It spent a week at the top of the charts and was hailed by critics as one of the best albums of the year.</p><p>Manson announced the release of his subsequent album, Eat Me, Drink Me, in 2005, but it wasn’t until mid-2007 that it was available. Manson was intimately involved in the writing, organizing, and production of the record, as he had been with his previous studio endeavors. In 2009, Manson and his old bandmate, Twiggy Ramirez, reformed and released the band’s seventh album, The High End of Low.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Marilyn_Manson><b><span data-contrast=none>What is the Net worth of Marilyn Manson?</span></b><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Marilyn Manson estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
