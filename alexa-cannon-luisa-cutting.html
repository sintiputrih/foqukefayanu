When an officer asked the blood-drenched woman what happened, she said, “I killed her.”</p><p>When police entered the apartment, they saw a woman with multiple stab wounds on the floor with a butcher knife stuck in her mouth.</p>A WSLS 10 News segment covering January’s gruesome incident.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Roanoke Times</a>, Cutting told police that “she was doing cocaine with the devil.” But cocaine wasn’t the only drug she was on in the day preceding her crime.</p><p>She told officers that she had also done mushrooms, Adderall, Xanax, marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco, as well.</p><p>On the morning of her murder, a neighbor said he heard screaming and arguing so he called emergency services. Commonwealth’s Attorney Chris Rehak explained that Cannon died of “multiple sharp force injuries.” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Cosmopolitan</a>, she was stabbed more than 30 times.</p><p>Cutting was questioned at the police station and confessed though she was also “rambling” and given to a “bizarre series of episodes.” Here Cutting stated that she had been doing cocaine with the devil.</p><p>She also spoke of the Apocalypse and recited the Hail Mary prayer in Spanish before she repeatedly tried to shove her entire fist into her mouth. Personnel consequently took her to a mental health clinic where she stayed for a whole week.</p><p>After search warrants were filed for investigators to comb through the apartment, they found pills, grinders, several smoking devices, and a brown, chalky material in the kitchen area.</p>A WFXR News segment on Monday’s sentencing of Luisa Cutting.<p>A post on Cannon’s Instagram account reveals that the two roommates had met online before living across from one another for one year and eventually moving in together.

The plea agreement also ordered that she have no contact with Cannon’s family and to follow any mental health treatment authorities impose on her during her term.</p><p>She will be on probation for a whole decade after her release in 2039.</p><p>After reading about the Virginia college student who stabbed her best friend to death after “doing cocaine with the devil,” learn about <a href=#>the woman who was sentenced to 10 years for making false rape claims</a>.
