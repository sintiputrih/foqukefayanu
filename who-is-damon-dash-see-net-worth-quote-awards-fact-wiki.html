However despite such wide activity in his business, today Dame’s net worth is negative and is estimated to be – $2 million. Dash is mostly known as one of the three co-founders of the famous “Roc-A-Fella Records” label, which presented many popular musicians such as Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Kanye West and many others. Moreover, Damon Dash is a cousin of the famous Stacey Dash – American TV and film actress. Not so long time ago Dash’s net worth was as high as $50 million, but nowadays his situation has worsened considerably.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=damon-dash-net-worth-2-million></span>Damon Dash Net Worth -$2 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Damon Dash is an African American born on May 3, 1971, in New York City, United States. As a teenager he tried many different jobs to earn some money and increase net worth – for example, he was selling newspapers and worked as a cleaner in a local shop. However, this basic net worth earned by Dash at an early age wasn’t dedicated to some generous purpose – he was just buying snacks, chocolates and shirts. As a teenager he attended a private school, but later was raised without his mother, who died from from asthma when her son was only 15 years. So Dash actually had to find some way to earn money and build up his net worth, and he kind of succeeded. In 1995 together with Jay-Z and Kareem Biggs he co-founded “Rock-A-Fella Records”. After that Dash was considered to be close friends with Jay-Z, who he was also representing, but later he failed to become as successful as Jay-Z did. In 2004 this record label was fully purchased by Def Jam Recordings, and one year after rapper Jay-Z managed to get rid of Dash when he agreed to be a president.</p><p>However, after that period of time Dash’s net worth started to decrease rapidly. He had many troubles with tax payments, argued with lawyers, furthermore, his divorce only worsened his situation. Damon started losing his net worth almost immediately, and in 2009 he announced to the judge that he actually had only $2 million. But even this wasn’t the end, and in the next five years things worsened even more. Dash wasn’t able to pay $700 monthly payment, while conversely his former partner Jay-Z was rising to fame. So now you know Damon Dash‘s situation.</p><p>As a film producer Damon Dash was involved in making the film “The Woodsman” which starred Kevin Bacon ,and one more popular film called “Paid in Full” together with Mekhi Phifer. Damon Dash also performed in both these films, however, it looks like these movies didn’t help Dame to become as rich as he was. Neither did his two clothing lines – CEO Clothing and Rocawear, founded together with Jay-Z.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Damon Dash</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>-$2
