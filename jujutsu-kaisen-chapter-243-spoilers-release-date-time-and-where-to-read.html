Recommended Videos The fight between Kenjaku and Fumihiko Takaba has been going on since chapter 240 of Jujutsu Kaisen, and it looks like we have already reached a conclusion.
Chapter 243 doesn’t wrap up the battle in the way that most people expected, and while some argue that it was anti-climatic, others are way too excited by a sudden return to care."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In fairness, nothing about this confrontation has been what one would expect to see in the fight, particularly due to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Takaba’s humorous cursed technique</a>, so it stands to reason that its conclusion would follow that pattern. With a fan-favorite character arriving in the nick of time to settle things, the story is about to take a wild turn for the better.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 243 spoilers</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>WE ARE SO FUCKING BACK YUUTA HIVE <a href=#>#jjk243</a> <a href=#>#jjkspoilers</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sTG9AkojF2</a></p>— angela ☆ (@artdiseasee) <a href=#>November 22, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>According to the leaks available, chapter 243 sees Kenjaku and Takaba on stage, a result of the latter’s cursed technique, as the two perform together. There’s a lot of back and forth between the two, but Kenjaku always manages to come out on top with his jokes. At one point, Takaba starts to grow sadder, eventually crying as he realizes that the show is coming to a conclusion.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>As the two are brought back to reality, we see Takaba lying on the floor and wearing white clothes, as if he were dead. He thanks Kenjaku, who smiles and admits that he is funny, seemingly preparing to end the sorcerer. Suddenly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuta Okkotsu</a> appears out of nowhere, and although Kenjaku feels his presence at the last second, it’s too late to use his cursed technique reversal.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>From the back, Yuta decapitates Kenjaku with his sword, and as his head rolls off, the villain wonders if this is all part of the plan. Yuta confirms it, claiming that Takaba wouldn’t have been able to kill Kenjaku, thus, his role was to conceal Yuta’s presence. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This seems like the end for the antagonist</a>, but the chapter ends with him affirming that his will shall live on.</p><h2 id=h-when-and-where-to-read-chapter-243-of-jujutsu-kaisen data-injectable=false>When and where to read chapter 243 of Jujutsu Kaisen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jujutsu-kaisen-chapter-239.jpg><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>To read chapter 243 of Jujutsu Kaisen when it officially releases, fans will have to wait until Sunday, Nov. 26.
