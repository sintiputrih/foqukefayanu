Where did you go?’ I said, ‘How am I supposed to tell secrets if I’m not allowed to tell lies?'” she said. “He was like, ‘Oh that’s good.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The interview also touched on other teenage topics for the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Asteroid City stars</a>, like first concerts (Maya’s was Hannah Montana/<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>, while Bryan’s was&nbsp;<strong>B.B. King</strong>), first cars (where Maya joked about a yellow cab being hers), and childhood celebrity crushes (Maya said&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Zac Efron</a>,&nbsp;</strong>while Bryan named&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Farrah Fawcett</strong></a>).</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Maya is the older of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two children</a> that Ethan shares with his ex-wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Uma Thurman,</a>&nbsp;</strong>53.
