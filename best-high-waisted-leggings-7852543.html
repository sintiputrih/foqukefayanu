They smooth your stomach, lift your booty, and create the illusion of longer legs. And who wants to wear a sports bra with low-rise leggings? Not us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yet finding the perfect high-waisted pair isn’t easy. With so many brands out there today, it’s hard to decipher which styles are worth the money over which ones roll, pinch, or simply show too much skin. So we spoke with fitness experts and then researched the best leggings in high quality materials, extensive size ranges and inseams, and various compression levels. Whether you’re looking to lounge in a pair of high-waisted leggings, want one for your most intense workout sessions, or need a few for your growing belly as a mom-to-be, we&nbsp;found&nbsp;the best pairs that you can add to your virtual cart right now.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-alo-yoga-high-waist-airlift-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alo Yoga High-Waist Airlift Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alo Yoga High-Waist Airlift Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VVjJ-iu7QVq52Iqqa_qlPBB3JVI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alo-yoga--high-waist-airlift-legging-819368c05d9145208d357847757cbe9d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alo Yoga&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Alo’s signature soft and stretchy Airlift fabric feels like a second skin while still providing smoothing and sculpting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The 28-inch inseam may be too long for petite figures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s nothing quite like a buttery pair of leggings, and Alo Yoga’s High-Waist Airlift Leggings is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best on the market</a> in our book. Constructed with an unbeatable softness and four-way stretch, these leggings will move with you during your workouts and errand runs. The extra-wide waistband sculpts and smooths while the high compression material lifts your booty for extra confidence with every step.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Further, you can trust the durability and excellence of this style thanks to Alo’s initiative to wear-test their products in-house—a definite bonus once you consider its higher price point. We also love the sheer number of colorways to choose from; there are three neutral “core” options and 12 brighter, bolder hues (like teal green and fluorescent pink) for you to peruse before you add to cart. With a 28 inch inseam, the legging may be a bit long for shorter folks, so you may want to consider the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">⅞ High-Waist Airlift Legging</a> instead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes</strong>: XXS-XL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 14 | <strong>Material</strong>:&nbsp;Polyester, elastane | <strong>Length</strong>: 28.5 inches | <strong>Compression</strong>: Light&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-old-navy-extra-high-waisted-powerchill-hidden-pocket-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Old Navy Hidden-Pocket Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Old Navy Extra High-Waisted PowerChill Hidden-Pocket Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Gb-LDDgpt6D8tv_l0e3EkW01QgM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/old-navy-extra-high-waisted-powerchill-hidden-pocket-leggings-e31397c8568a4aeeae472c124cdae5b6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Old Navy</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These affordable leggings come in a wide range of sizes and offer smart features, like hidden pockets.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>With light compression, these leggings aren’t meant for intense workouts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Old Navy has been one of our go-to spots for budget-friendly athleisure pieces for as long as we can remember, so believe us when we say that the brand’s Extra High-Waisted PowerChill Hidden-Pocket Leggings are the real deal. There are tons of features that make this pair a must-have in your rotation aside from the low price point, including the lightweight, cotton blend material with&nbsp;four-way stretch for added flexibility and the flatlock seams that prevent that frustrating chafing feeling. A hidden pocket in the waistband for keys or cash? Say less. We also have to applaud Old Navy for its extensive size range as well as offering this style in tall and petite inseams. The cotton makeup and light compression make these leggings better suited for the couch than the court, but hey, we’re not complaining.

Well that’s the beauty of these drawstring leggings, a genius design that makes us willing to pay the extra price. We’ve worn these pants on long plane rides and road trips, and never once felt uncomfortable, because we could adjust the tightness. Plus they don’t roll down since they are the right fit. Besides the comfort factor, there’s something intriguing about the lace-up design, which can help you snatch your waist if you please. Who knew a style borrowed from football could be sexy?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The medium compression makes the material versatile for all sorts of activities while the ribbing adds some stylish texture. Not to mention, this pair comes in 14 different colors, from mint green to hot pink to classic neutrals, so you’re guaranteed to find a hue to match your favorite sports bras or workout tops. The only thing that could make this pair better? A side pocket, but stashing your phone in the waistband works too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS-2X | <strong>Colors</strong>: 14 | <strong>Material</strong>: Nylon, spandex active rib | <strong>Length</strong>: 26.5 inches | <strong>Compression</strong>: Medium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-superfit-hero-superhold-pocket-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Superfit Hero Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Superfit Hero Superhold Pocket Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dKf_5Q324T7mydw0M6PRUvNI_EU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Superfit-Hero-Superhold-Pocket-Leggings-a494516641734c27875726c94785555f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Superfit Hero</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This style comes exclusively in plus-sizes, and the fabric is thick, compressive, and squat-proof.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The brushed fabric easily picks up pet hair and lint.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to finding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plus-size leggings</a>, not many brands can boast quality pairs with inclusive sizing like SuperFit Hero can. The brand’s Pocket Leggings are made exclusively in sizes L through 7X, and each size is fit-tested by real athletes. Super compressive with non-slip and non-roll security, the Pocket Leggings will become your new best friend during high-impact workouts. And when your routines calls for squats and deadlifts, the opaque, quick-drying fabric has got you covered. As the name suggests, there’s two roomy pockets for stashing your phone and other essentials. While the brushed fabric is super soft, it does attract pet hair and lint easily, so if you have a fur baby, you may want to go with another style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes</strong>: L-7X | <strong>Colors</strong>: 6 | <strong>Material</strong>: Polyester,&nbsp;spandex | <strong>Length</strong>: 29 inches | <strong>Compression</strong>: High&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-athleta-ultra-high-rise-elation-78-tight></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Ultra High Rise Elation 7/8 Tight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Ultra High Rise Elation 7/8 Tight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OffAEz55aDNq1ljjylOn5Dg2lM4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/athleta-ultra-high-rise-elation-78-tight-068a63bbb0674ba1bf51733ced2698ff.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The petite size range available for this pair allows shorter shoppers to wear quality leggings without them looking ill-fitting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>These aren’t the most booty-enhancing leggings that we’ve seen.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone who is petite knows that shopping for leggings is a pain as too many styles bunch at the ankles or go up way too high, nearly reaching your rib cage. That’s why we love Athleta, one of the brands that actually offer leggings in petite sizes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jessie Diaz-Herrera, a certified fitness instructor and creator of the body-positive dance movement Free the Jiggle, is also a fan. “If you're looking for a lighter but still strong hold, I would&nbsp;go with the Ultra High-Rise Elation 7/8 Tight,” Diaz-Herrera says. “I personally get them at 7/8 length because I'm 5 '1 and don't gather on the bottom. Great short girl hack!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Crafted from the brand’s signature&nbsp;Powervita fabric, the leggings are buttery soft yet offer medium compression, especially in the tummy area thanks to a three-layer waistband with mesh inner lining. While we love the supportive waistband complete with a back pocket, some wish the waist seam sat higher in the back to better define the booty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes</strong>: XXS-3X (petite and tall size ranges available) | <strong>Colors</strong>: 6 | <strong>Material</strong>: Nylon, lycra | <strong>Length</strong>: 25 inches (regular/plus), 23 inches (petite), 28 inches (tall) | <strong>Compression</strong>: Medium<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-carbon38-high-rise-full-length-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Carbon38 High Rise Full-Length Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Carbon38 High Rise Full-Length Legging Carbon38 High Rise Full-Length Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2_wmOeMuVzeFHpI7aZcLz6-BRNA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/carbon38-high-rise-full-length-legging-6977ef07bc85443985916f327a725814.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Carbon38&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A 31-inch inseam makes this pair the perfect full-length fit for a tall wearer.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The light fabric may not feel supportive enough for high impact workouts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simple, sleek, lightweight—Carbon38’s High-Rise Full-Length Legging boasts these qualities and more, and is especially perfect if your stature is on the taller side. With a full-length inseam of 31 inches and ultra-wide waistband, this style doesn’t fall short on tall shoppers who are tired of ill-fitting leggings. The brand’s signature “Melt” fabric offers buttery softness and light compression, which may not be supportive enough for vigorous activity, but can be perfect for hot girl walks and running errands. We’re also obsessed with the range of neutrals, bold hues like fuchsia and aqua, and earth tones like brown and olive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS-XL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 7 | <strong>Material</strong>: Nylon, spandex | <strong>Length</strong>: 31 inches&nbsp;| <strong>Compression</strong>: Light</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-options-colorfulkoala-womens-buttery-soft-high-waisted-full-length-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color Options</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Colorfulkoala Women's Buttery Soft High Waisted Full-Length Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Colorfulkoala Women's Buttery Soft High Waisted Full-Length Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VUw06XWRcHSSvsepvLq2_1-HaOE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/colorfulkoala-womens-buttery-soft-high-waisted-full-length-leggings-c94557edd6c543b8aeeaee1299f6c9f6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Colorfulkoala</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These affordable leggings come in more than 20 colors.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>With light compression, these bottoms don’t shape or sculpt as much as others.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone needs a pair of colorful leggings in their wardrobe, and few compare to this budget-friendly find from Colorfulkoala. Buttery-soft, flexible with a four-way stretch, and ultra-lightweight, this high-waisted pair is the perfect addition to your usual leggings rotation — there’s even a hidden waistband pocket. For added comfort and to prevent chafing, the Buttery Soft Leggings are constructed with flatlock seams on the legs — a plus if you’re averse to bulky seams found with other styles. Though they have a thick waistband, some wished the leggings offered more sculpting throughout. While we love this pair for a multitude of reasons, we can’t get over the fact that leggings of this quality are under $25 — and come in more than 20 colorways.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS-XL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 21 | <strong>Material</strong>: Nylon, spandex | <strong>Length</strong>: 28 inches | <strong>Compression</strong>: Light&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-compression-girlfriend-collective-compressive-high-rise-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Compression</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective High-Rise Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Girlfriend Collective Black Compressive High-Rise Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LwJXyy_rLKCubR1cNF0ufK1QMvs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Girlfriend-Collective-Black-Compressive-High-Rise-Legging-d222386abac94fd594eb78ce1ce01f69.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Girlfriend Collective</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The size range is extensive and there are even three different inseam lengths offered to accommodate petite and tall shoppers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some of the lighter shades can show sweat and panty lines.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Compressive High-Rise Legging is Girlfriend Collective’s best-selling legging, and we’re not stumped as to why. Ideal for high-impact activities like running and biking, this style will keep you feeling supported without limiting your flexibility (thanks to the&nbsp;material’s four-way stretch), and quickly wicks away sweat. The waistband is also double-layered for added security, and even comes with a hidden pocket for storing smaller items while on-the-go.

Not only do the sizes range from XXS to 6XL, but there are multiple inseam lengths available: 19.5 inches (perfect for petites), 23.5 inches, and 28.5 inches (ideal for taller folks). And while we love the variation of colors, some of the lighter shades tend to be less forgiving, showing sweat and panty lines underneath.

The beauty of flared leggings, like the Raquel High Waist Flared Legging, is that they elongate your legs and go with an array of shoes, so you can wear them to the gym and beyond. Yet the flared hem in this style is not too wide, so you can still feel like your bottoms are functional enough to work out in (while still looking cute).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the four-way stretch, compressive, sweat-wicking fabric, and ultra-high-rise waistband make this pair ideal for any type of sweat-inducing activity, whether that’s yoga, an intense gym session, or just a brisk walk around the block. Further, the Raquel Flared Legging comes in a multitude of colorways—14 to be exact—and three inseam lengths to accommodate a variety of height ranges. However, some petite shoppers report that even the shorter inseam is too long, so you may want to take advantage of the brand’s five day trial period to test them out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS-XXL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 14 | <strong>Material</strong>: Nylon, polyester, spandex | <strong>Length</strong>: 30 inches, 32 inches, 34 inches | <strong>Compression</strong>: Medium&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-78-outdoor-voices-seamlesssmooth-78-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best 7/8</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Outdoor Voices SeamlessSmooth 7/8 Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Outdoor Voices SeamlessSmooth 7/8 Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JFwSSwbQ4u3u2aQEvUYTCeYsLFA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/outdoor-voices-seamlesssmooth-78-legging-411bc6ccc9db4fdf874d782a452bdc3c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Outdoor Voices</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These leggings are offered in cool colorways and aren’t see-through.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They tend to run big.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love ⅞ leggings since they hit right at the sweet spot where they aren’t too short but also don’t bunch around your ankles. If a pair of leggings from Outdoor Voices isn’t already in your workout gear rotation, consider adding the SeamlessSmooth ⅞ Legging to it if you want something cool, comfortable, and perfect for any medium-impact activities. Like the others we’ve mentioned, this pair is high-waisted, outfitted with a thick waistband that keeps you feeling secure during your workout without restraining you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also made from Outdoor Voices’ signature <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SeamlessSmooth</a> fabric, which is “soft to the touch” and boasts a, as the name suggests, seamless and smooth appearance.

With a colorful stripe on the sides of each leg stretching from the top of the waistband to the ankles, this pair is a sleek upgrade from the other basic pairs you likely already have in your closet.

Not only does this style come in 20 different hues, giving you multiple options for all the days in the week, but the comfort level is unmatched, making it difficult for you to ever want to wear a pair of jeans or slacks again. Ideal for low-impact workouts, lounging on your couch all day catching up on TV, or for strolling through your local Trader Joes, the cozy and flexible TLC Leggings will become your new everyday obsession. This pair’s price point is a little on the steep side, but with the amount of wear you’ll get out of it, it’s worth the extra splurge in our opinion. While we love knowing that these are made to order, that does mean they take longer to ship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes</strong>: XXS-3X | <strong>Colors</strong>: 20 | <strong>Material</strong>: Polyester, spandex | <strong>Length</strong>: 25.5 inches | <strong>Compression</strong>: High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-pockets-vuori-daily-pocket-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best With Pockets</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Daily Pocket Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1004 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Daily Pocket Legging " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UYoiaNyv3oJW6XfOeWGtzpBPe-w=/fit-in/1500x1004/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vuori-daily-pocket-legging-33e663289802468592cdfa38726752a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The side pockets on this pair are large enough to hold a smartphone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Lint and hairs tend to catch on the fabric.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A high-waisted legging is revered for its comfort and security, but a high-waisted legging with pockets, on the other hand, takes those benefits to a whole new level.

The Salutation Stash Capri is a fan favorite from Athleta shoppers — its Powervita fabric is as soft as butter, sweat-wicking, and even has UPF 50 protection, so you can feel comfortable sporting this pair outside without worrying about a sunburn. The Salutation Stash Capri also comes complete with pockets on each hip that are large enough to store a cardholder or your smartphone. What’s better? There are three different inseam lengths available for this pair — regular, tall, and petite — that hit mid-calf for that perfect capri fit.

Thankfully, a lot of brands offer styles in regular, petite, and tall inseams to cater to all ends of the height spectrum. But a good rule of thumb for petites is to look for leggings with inseams that fall between 19 to 24 inches, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Athleta’s Ultra High-Rise Elation 7/8 Tight</a>. Those who are tall should look for inseams anywhere between 28 to 31 inches. When in doubt, check the size guide and reviews to see if other customers discuss the length of the leggings.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Waist Height</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While all of the picks on this list feature a high-rise waistband, not all brands have the same idea of “high-rise” in mind. A traditional high-waisted pair will hit either at your belly button or just above, as seen in styles like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vuori’s Daily Pocket Legging</a>.

While higher waistbands made from supportive fabric should stay put, according to Liotta, rolling often is an indication that you are wearing the wrong size. So before cutting off the price tag, it’s best to try the leggings out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Bend over, stretch your hands over your head, run in place,” says Bruhn. “If at any point, the waist starts rolling down, they are not the best fit for you. If it is a little compression and support that you’re looking for, find a wider band that goes across the stomach.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are high-waisted leggings compressive?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While high-waist bands tend to offer more smoothing and support, that doesn’t necessarily mean the leggings are meant to be compressive, according to Bruhn. To ensure you get all the sculpting you want, look for leggings with high compression levels, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Girlfriend Collective’s Compressive High-Rise Legging</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What underwear should you wear under high-waisted leggings?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While underwear preference is totally up to whatever the wearer feels most comfortable in, Bruhn recommends wearing a thong in order to have the most seamless look with no panty lines. If you’re worried about missing the coverage that panties provide, have no fear. “The stretchy fabric from the legging should naturally hold you in, creating a smooth look with plenty of coverage,” says Bruhn.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even thongs can create panty lines — we’re looking at you, lacy designs — so it’s best to stick with lightweight, seamless options.
