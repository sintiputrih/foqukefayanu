A month later, the pair were screaming at each other at the reunion. A month after that, they were getting along again.</p><p>The recent fight, which aired during the March 14 episode, stemmed from a great deal of he-said, she-said drama. Rumors began that Reza’s husband, <strong>Adam Neely</strong>, was cheating on him and some thought that MJ started the rumors to stir up drama. She denied ever being involved but when they came face-to-face, everything blew up.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During their fight, both said quite harsh words but MJ felt that Reza went too low, yelling, “You had ten abortions! Your uterus exploded cause you had ten abortions!”</p><p>She later yelled back, “You’re a disgusting person. Go back to your stupid husband. Cheat on each other, go to bathhouses.”</p><p>Shahs of Sunset airs on Bravo Fridays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqhmZioerCyjKysp6uVqXq0usSaomaolZq4br7Es5hmm6KesrR5w66poqaXYrqmsdNmrKllp57BqXnMo2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
