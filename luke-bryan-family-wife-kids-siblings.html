Caroline is the daughter of an insurance agency operator called Yvonne Boyer and a social specialist called Waymond Boyer.</p><p>She had her elementary and high school education in the US and later graduated from Georgia State University, where she met her husband and also took part in extracurricular and curricular activities. She was part of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority as a student. She was equally smart and famous for making brilliant public presentations at GSU.</p><p>Mrs. Boyer is a Master’s degree holder. She went ahead to obtain the certificate after declining to pursue a career in the entertainment industry as an actress or singer, as advised by her tutors who were impressed with her stage talent.

Two of these kids are their biological children while three are Luke’s nephew and nieces. The names of the singer’s children are Thomas Boyer Bryan (born 2008) and Tatum Christopher Bryan (born 2011).</p><p>Not much is known about Thomas and Tatum as their parents do not say much about them. Their father, however, revealed sometime in his Instagram post that his boys are his most reliable ”litmus test”. According to him, what this means is that any song Thomas and Tatum shows a preference for from his catalog of tracks usually becomes a hit. Bryan’s boys show great interest in sports, as well as fishing and hunting. They’ve gone on a fishing adventure with their parents on several occasions.</p><p>Til Cheshire, Jordan Cheshire, and Kris Cheshire are the names of Luke’s adopted kids. The trio was adopted after the husband of Bryan’s older sister Kelly Bryan (Ben Lee Cheshire) died in the year 2014.

She believed so much in his younger brother and was his biggest fan. Kelly, in 2007, arranged for more than 100 supporters of Luke’s fan to watch him while he makes his first appearance at the Grand Ole Opry in the month of April of the same year. She also graced the occasion and took photographs with her brother; it was their last appearance together before her death.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Performed my new song #BuildMeADaddy for @FallonTonight a couple weeks ago. Even though we didn’t have our usual on-set performance, it was special filming in this beautiful place. Thanks for having me on Jimmy. https://t.co/JF5jrtxgZc pic.twitter.com/mxIPrdsoev</p><p>— Luke Bryan (@LukeBryanOnline) July 9, 2020</p><p>Kelly Bryan’s death was devastating and painful because she passed away when her brother needed her most. She is said to have died from unknown causes in her home while taking care of her little son. The real cause of her death is yet to be ascertained, although Luke has since moved on from the tragedy.</p><p>Not much is known about the personal life of the singer’s older sister, however, we can establish that she was married to Ben Lee Cheshire with whom she had three kids. Mr. Cheshire passed away in 2014, leaving behind Jordan, Til, and Kris who have now found solace with the singer and his wife.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kelly-is-not-the-only-sibling-luke-bryan-lost-tragically></span><strong>Kelly Is Not The Only Sibling Luke Bryan Lost Tragically</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Country singer Luke Bryan is the youngest child of his parents. He had an older sister and brother called Chris Bryan who passed away when he was a teenager. Chris died in a car accident in November 1996 while Luke was making serious preparations to move to Nashville for his music career.</p><p>The tragic death resulted in Bryan staying back in Leesburg to mourn Chris’s death with his family. He eventually spent five years with them and also completed his college studies in the city. He also featured with a music band at local clubs at the time and worked in his father’s company for a while before his dad encouraged him to leave Leesburg for Nashville.</p><p>Detailed information about Chris’s life including his educational background, early life, and career is not known to the public.
