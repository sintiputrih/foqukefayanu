She received dialysis regularly, used the time to craft her jokes, and even talked about her hospital stays in her act. Lester had such a relaxed stage presence, you’d hardly know she read her crowds and tailored her sets with topics spanning from Bitcoin and slut shaming to the Detroit native’s prior life as a one-time madame and later a wrestling manager.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tba30952yamce1xlq0b2@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tba30953yamcqxiq4rc5@published data-word-count=101><span style=font-weight:400>It’s bad enough to lose someone as young and beloved as Lester, but it’s made all the more cosmically wrong knowing her star was on the rise.
