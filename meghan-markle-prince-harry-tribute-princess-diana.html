We will forever miss her." A third added: "She was an amazing person. It is wonderful to see her legacy carried forward." <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a> often talks about his close relationship with his late mum, and the devastating impact her death had on his life. In an interview with in 2016, the royal spoke about his charity work and his determination to ensure that her legacy is never forgotten. He said: "We will do everything we can to make sure she's never forgotten and carry on all of the special gifts, as such, that she portrayed while she was alive.

When he announced his engagement to Meghan in November 2017, his late mother was very much at the forefront of his thoughts and actions. For the first photocall the couple chose to meet the press in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace, where a white garden had been planted earlier this year to commemorate Princess Diana 20 years after her death. Meghan's ring, designed by the Prince, also paid tribute to Meghan's late mother-in-law to be. Two stones from Diana's private jewellery collection were included in the now-iconic ring. "It is days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news," Harry said in a BBC interview. "But with the ring and everything that's going on, I'm sure she is with us, jumping up and down somewhere else."</p><p id=e-V18xAPAcsx data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
