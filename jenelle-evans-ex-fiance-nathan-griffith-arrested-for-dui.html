We’re still going to fight for primary custody.”</p><p>He went on: “I think — just with her situation — I would just be more fit as a parent raising Kaiser. I can give him that one-on-one, I can give him that love and affection that only a boy and a father can share. You know, I see a lot of myself in Kaiser, and I don’t want him to make the same mistakes I did. And he’s just not getting the love and attention, I think, that he needs.”</p><p>Griffith has been arrested multiple times. He was <a href=#>handcuffed for DUI</a> in North Myrtle Beach, North Carolina, in September 2013 after he and Evans were spotted driving recklessly, with the reality star telling officers that she and Griffith were “trying to have sex.”</p><p>He was busted for driving with a suspended license, resisting arrest, driving on the wrong side of the road and giving a false name and address to officers in April 2014, receiving a 47-day jail sentence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nathan-Griffith-and-Kaiser-Nathan-Griffith-Arrested-for-DUI-Mugshot.jpg><p>The former Marine was <a href=#>arrested for domestic violence</a> in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, in March 2015, though the charges were later dropped.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And he was “issued a ticket, <a href=#>arrested</a> and charged with striking fixtures while driving on a highway and a failure to report these collisions,” in the same city in February 2018.</p><p>Evans revealed <a href=#>her split from Griffith</a> in August 2015.
