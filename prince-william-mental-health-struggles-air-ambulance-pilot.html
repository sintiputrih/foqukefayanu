It was one of those things that I just instantly took to and thought, 'This is really cool.' I really enjoy it," he said, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/royals/prince-william-recalls-traumatic-work-experience-air-ambulance-pilot/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite enjoying the work, William said there were still "difficult situations." He explained, "Seeing patients and families ripped apart on almost a daily basis, that routine, you just get into a habit of head down and get on with it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One patient in particular greatly affected the Duke of Cambridge.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Immediately it became clear that this young person was in serious difficulty, sadly been hit by a car," he said. "And of course there are some things in life you don't really want to see. And all we cared about at the time was fixing this boy. And the parents are very hysterical, as you can imagine, screaming, wailing, not knowing what to do, you know, and in, in real agony themselves. And that lives with you."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His team was ultimately able to stabilize the boy. But even so, William "went home that night pretty upset but not noticeably."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I wasn't in tears," he said, "but inside, I felt something had changed. I felt a sort of, a real tension inside of me."</p><img alt="the queen and duke of edinburgh open new base of east anglian air ambulance at cambridge airport" title="The Queen & Duke Of Edinburgh Open New Base Of East Anglian Air Ambulance At Cambridge Airport" width=2715 height=3362 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-walks-across-the-helipad-news-photo-1638802511.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Prince William walks across the helipad after piloting his air ambulance into land at the East Anglian Air Ambulance base at Cambridge Airport in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">William said he wasn't able to fully process those emotions until weeks after the event.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was like someone had put a key in a lock and opened it without me giving permission to do that. I felt like the whole world was dying," he said. "It's an extraordinary feeling. You just feel everyone's in pain, everyone's suffering. And that's not me. I've never felt that before. My personal life and everything was absolutely fine. I was happy at home and happy at work, but I kept looking at myself, going, 'Why am I feeling like this? Why do I feel so sad?' And I started to realize that, actually, you're taking home people's trauma, people's sadness, and it's affecting you."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Eventually, William began to open up to his coworkers about his mental health struggles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was lucky enough that I had someone to talk to at work in the Air Ambulance because mental health where I was working was very important," he said. "Talking about those jobs definitely helped, sharing them with the team, and ultimately, in one case, meeting the family and the, the patient involved who made a recovery, albeit not a full recovery, but made a recovery."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He encouraged those listening to seek out help if they're struggling with a similar experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You're not alone, and it's okay. It's about what you do next," he said. "It's about having that boldness and that openness and that strength to go, 'It's going to be a long journey. It's not going to be easy, but I'm going to get there.'"</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
