Also, he proceeded to become a quarterback for the Denver Broncos.</p><p>He would hold this position for his entire professional football career. In 1985, he shattered the Bronco’s single-season record for attempts (605), completions (327), passing yards (3,891), and more.</p><p>Then, in 1986, Elway led the Broncos to their first American Football Conference (AFC) Championship in almost ten years.</p><p>In 1987, Elway was named the NFL’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) and was named to the Sporting News All-NFL team.</p><p>Elway was also named the Colorado Pro Athlete of the Year by the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame and was voted the Broncos’ offensive MVP.</p><p>Playing in Super Bowl XXII, he made history by becoming the first quarterback in a Super Bowl to catch a pass.</p><p>The beginning of 1989 saw Elway at his second Super Bowl in which he scored the only touchdown made by his team.</p><p>Despite a persistent shoulder injury, Elway led his team in touchdowns in 1991, with a then career-high of six.</p><p>Likewise, in the 1992 off-season, he had his shoulder injury corrected by arthroscopic surgery.</p><p>In the 1992 regular season, Elway was back in action and better than ever throwing the longest touchdown pass of his career, 80 yards.</p><p>In 1993, Elway was named AFC MVP by the NFL Players Association, as well as AFC Offensive Player of the Year by United Press International (UPI) and AFC Player of the Year by Football News.</p><p>Also this year he was named to the all-AFC team by UPI and Football News, as well as second-team All-NFL by the Associated Press, College, Pro Football Weekly, and Football Digest.</p><p>In 1995, Elway scored 26 touchdowns, made 14 interceptions, and threw for more than 300 yards five separate times—all career bests for him.</p><p>His 26 touchdowns also set a record for the Broncos.

He found his answer in the form of a part ownership stake in an Arena Football League (AFL) team called the Colorado Crush.</p><p>The team, which intended to begin regularly scheduled games in 2003, gave Elway the spirit of competition and the role in a business for which he had been searching. Best of all, it allowed Elway to stay in the game of football.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-68274 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/John-Albert-Elway-Jr.-on-the-football-field.jpg alt="John Albert Elway Jr." width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-68274 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: John Albert Elway Jr. on the football field (Source: Mile High Report)</p><h4><span>Awards and Nomination</span></h4><p>Recognition for John Albert Elway Jr.’s achievements came yet again in 1997.
