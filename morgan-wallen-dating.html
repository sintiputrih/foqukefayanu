The answer to that question seems to change like the wind. According to a source for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, Morgan was involved with model Paige Lorenze, and the couple was seemingly together secretly for about a year before people knew.</p><p>"They’ve been together for almost a year now," a source for the publication shared in 2022.

Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, the mom of three didn't exactly deny that she'd been out with the "Chasin' You" crooner.</p><p>But it doesn't seem that Morgan and Kristin are a couple.</p><p>On the other hand, he may be in a relationship with social media star <a href=#>Gia Duddy</a>.

Phew!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Morgan Wallen was previously engaged and has a son from that relationship.</h2><p>No matter who he's seeing now, Morgan's most serious romance was with Katie Smith, to whom he was once engaged, and who is actually also the mother of his son, Indigo.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Morgan and Katie's relationship story is quite a short one in the grand scheme of things. The duo began dating back in December 2016, and after less than a year of whirlwind romance, decided to get engaged in April 2017. That didn't last, however, as they decided to call off their engagement in August 2018, barely four months after announcing it. Eventually, Morgan and Katie broke up for good in November 2019.</p><p>Morgan's relationship with Katie may have been tumultuous, but it gave way to some of the music that defined the early days of his career. Hit songs of his such as "Whiskey Glasses" and "Chasin’ You" were written and composed while he and Katie were together, so it's clear that the time had a huge impact on his creative process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyzs8CnZLCZnKGyr3nDmquippc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
