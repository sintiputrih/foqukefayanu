Authorities have uncovered unsettling details about his past, including a prior threat to carry out a gun attack at a U.S. Army base.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Robert Card Biography</h2><p>Robert Card is described as standing at a height of 5’11” and weighing approximately 230 pounds. His last known address was in Bowdoin, Maine, lending an air of urgency to the ongoing search for this individual.</p><p>Card’s educational journey led him to the University of Maine, where he pursued studies in engineering. However, it remains unclear whether he successfully completed his education at the university.</p><p>The Maine Department of Public Safety has disclosed that Card is affiliated with the U.S. Army Reserve, boasting an active military ID. Although initial reports suggested that Card possessed firearms expertise, authorities have since tempered this assertion. It has been revealed that he grappled with mental health issues, even disclosing auditory hallucinations. Alarmingly, he had previously made threats of violence, specifically an ominous promise to carry out a shooting at the military base where he was stationed.</p><p>In a disconcerting turn of events, Card spent a significant period—two weeks, to be precise—at a mental health facility during the summer. However, he was subsequently released back into the community.</p><p>Law enforcement agencies have issued a stern warning that he should not be approached under any circumstances. He is considered armed and dangerous, and his potential access to a substantial quantity of ammunition heightens the urgency of the situation.</p><p>Following the tragic shooting incident, Card was believed to have been driving a 2013 white Subaru Outback with a black bumper. Notably, a “vehicle of interest” was located in Lisbon, Maine, potentially shedding light on his movements and whereabouts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/uFouMn9l7rM/hqdefault.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Robert Card Age</h2><p>As of 2023, he was known to be 40 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Robert Card Parents</h2><p>There are no details about his parents.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Robert Card Wife</h2><p>Details about his wife, as well as his love life, are not known.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Robert Card Children</h2><p>There is no information about his children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Robert Card Net Worth</h2><p>Details about his net worth are not known.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqumm52iqXqkrdGdZJuhn2KuqLGMqZirnZ6pwG7DyJ%2BcZpuYnrmlvsSnZKedpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
