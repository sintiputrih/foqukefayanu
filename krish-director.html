S. Rajamouli, expressed his admiration for the film and even agreed to do an interview with Krish for television channels. When Krish’s team asked for Rajamouli’s permission to use the interview for other media platforms, to which, Rajamouli agreed. However, a Telugu newspaper published the interview, portraying as if Rajamouli had written a letter to Krish, to express his appreciation for the film. This angered Rajamouli, and he asked Krish’s team for an explanation of what had happened. Rajamouli also posted about the letter on his social media account, telling that excerpts from his interview were presented in the form of a letter. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_3><a href=#>[3]</a></span><br><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/S.-S.-Rajamoulis-Tweet.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></li></ul><ul><li>During the shooting of the film “Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi” in 2018, Krish left its direction due to creative differences with Kangana Ranaut. Reportedly, Kangana was interfering with the direction of the film, and she had humiliated and pushed Krish out of the film. According to Kangana, she had to take the role of director after Krish left the film to work on NTR‘s biopic. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_4><a href=#>[4]</a></span> <img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Director-Krish-with-Kangana-Ranaut.jpeg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36607 class=wp-caption-text>Director Krish with Kangana Ranaut</p></li></ul><ul><li>After the release of “Manikarnika” in 2019, Kangana Ranaut claimed that she had directed 70% of the film, which angered Krish, who was credited as the co-director of the film. According to Krish-<br><p>Kangana has done 20-25 per cent of the first half and 10-15% in the second half. I didn’t shoot a song and I didn’t shoot her entry scene. In the second half, she has even re-shot some scenes which I had done in a different way. I don’t think how Kangana can sleep well by taking the first credit in direction when she does not deserve it.</p><p>In response to Krish, her sister, Rangoli Chandel, lashed out at him in a series of tweets, in which she told that Kangana had begged him to take the credits for the film but Krish did everything to ruin the film. In reply to rangoli, Krish said- <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_5><a href=#>[5]</a></span></p><p>Kangana and I are both not going away from this industry so soon. I will direct many more films in future and so will she. People will know who stands where.
