MOSCOW, IDAHO: Bryan Kohberger, 28, was arrested Friday, December 30, in connection with the murders of four University of Idaho students, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Ethan Chapin, 20, and Xana Kernodle, 20. As the investigation continues, many legal experts, including Jason LaBar, Kohberger's attorney, contend the affidavit contains many &#34;holes.&#34;
Jason was in a telephone interview with News Nation journalist Brian Entin."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As the investigation continues, many legal experts, including Jason LaBar, Kohberger's attorney, contend the affidavit contains many "holes."</p><p>Jason was in a telephone interview with News Nation journalist Brian Entin. When the journalist asked in the interview, "Were you surprised by the amount of evidence? Did you think it was solid?" He said, "I wasn't too surprised. I thought it was a strong circumstantial case that had holes and that could be exposed by a competent, good defense attorney like Attorney Taylor, I felt."</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Internet wonders if Bryan Kohberger's dad knew of murders as footage shows them being stopped TWICE for speeding</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Idaho murders: Kaylee Goncalves’ family lawyer claims Bryan Kohberger had 'no connection' to the victims</a></p><p>Further, Entin asked, "What would you say the biggest holes are?" He responded, "I have been talking about the biggest evidence and going step by step because the defense is going to attack each part of the evidence separately, really, because the case is really based upon circumstantial evidence. There's no direct evidence against Bryan. So, there are cases in the hole, where the defense will be attacking each piece of evidence individually. I believe at least that would be my trial strategy. So if you talk about the sheath being found in the room, you have <a href=# rel>DNA recovered</a> from the button of the closure of the sheath. What you can say about that is it's transferred DNA, it's touch DNA. That DNA could be on there. Nobody knows how long, if undisturbed, certainly could be a year, it could be longer."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Part 1/3: My full conversation with Bryan Kohberger’s Pennsylvania public defender Jason LaBar tonight.<br>He says he thought the probable cause affidavit was a “strong circumstantial case that had holes.” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kxIpz01qXw</a></p>— Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) <a href=#>January 12, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>The lawyer further added, "Experts going to testify that obviously it was placed on there because Bryan touched it, but they can't say when he touched it. Now, there could be additional evidence that comes out about that sheath, one being it could be actual DNA on it. State police executed a search warrant for Bryan's blood when they were here in Pennsylvania, and we don know if that's additional evidence that may come out there's unidentified blood on the sheath in addition to the sheath, the knife itself obviously not found, but we don't have the results of the autopsy. So we don't know if it's consistent with a straight-edge weapon or not. Certainly, that would change my feelings about the affidavit of probable cause, too."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/0fdde88a-a84b-4cd8-aa54-edf44b4bb5a0.jpg><p>Meanwhile, previously, experts have also suggested Kohberger's attorney could find "holes" in the affidavit. California-based law experts, Lara Yeretsian told, "In this case, what I've noticed is they’ve got evidence, and they’ve tried to put together the pieces of the puzzle. But each and every one of the pieces of the puzzle seem to have issues and weaknesses and places where a defense attorney can poke holes," as per<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Fox News. </a>One of the main holes in the affidavit as suggested by Yerestian is regarding the location of the phone. "What if he had a friend in the area he was going to visit?" she asked. "There may have been a very innocent reason for why he may have been in the area. I don’t know. You don’t know. For us, that’s not enough."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/164632c0-3648-49b4-bec5-398ac4642287.jpg><p>Another possible hole in the affidavit suggested by Pat Diaz, a private investigator and former Miami-Dade homicide detective, is regarding the shoe reference. "It could've been anybody coming out of that door. Although the sneakers, like Kohberger's white Hyundai Elantra, may not be the most practical for the hilly college town." Yeretsian also added regarding the "bushy eyebrows" reference in the affidavit.</p><p>The expert suggested, "It's circumstantial — it's like building blocks. No one really saw his face. ‘Bushy eyebrows?’ There's a lot of guys who have bushy eyebrows.&nbsp; What they had from the eyewitness, it could’ve been millions of guys that fit that profile or that description. It adds a little bit, he needs to fit within that description, but it doesn’t really single him out." Yeretsian had also explained the possibility that there are other suspects who may have wanted to harm one or more of the victims. "Have they talked to these people?" she asked. "Have they figured out what their alibi is? Have they looked at their cell site information? I'm sure that the defense is going to be asking for all of those."</p><h2 class=split>'I hope the police/FBI have enough evidence to fill in all those holes'</h2><p>The Internet had different theories and opinions on the interview. A user said, "I hope the police/fbi have enough evidence to fill in all those holes. I'd be looking real hard at that path he took home. But then again maybe that's what he wants them to do. I just don't want him walking free." Another added, "Am I the only one who wonders if he did it, did he do it on purpose as a kind of case study? As sick as that sounds, with his interest in criminal justice, I just keep coming back to that horrible thought. Could he have done it to live the experience/process?."</p><p>A comment read, "Strong circumstantial cases are Good." A user said, "Well, he's not going to say, oh it's so strong, Bryan is definitely going down. He's a defender." A comment stated, "I’d be allowed to say all of this? He said what I basically was thinking already. Although I’m sure they have a lot more." "He is right, it is impossible to find a jury in Idaho without knowing the case," claimed a user. "Defense could argue that BK’s knife/sheath was stolen out of his car during a break in. Reasonable doubt. Unless there is more DNA found at the crime scene, the sheath itself is not enough evidence IMO," wrote a user.&nbsp;</p><p>Another claimed, "He's right about the holes. There's a plethora of them. Wanting BK to be guilty isn't enough. The TL is a problem. 0412 tiktok forensics. 0420 white blur goes by gas station camera. Even if right after DD delivery. Not feasible in such a tiny window. Jmo." "Full of holes huh? I almost puked reading that. The AD document alone was solid. The other evidence will only add more. Some people are just sick," commented a user. Another wondered, "It is full of holes..I'm sure they have other evidence. If not, he'll walk rather easily. Imo."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I hope the police/fbi have enough evidence to fill in all those holes. I'd be looking real hard at that path he took home.
