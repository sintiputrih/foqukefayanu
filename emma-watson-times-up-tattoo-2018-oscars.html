The 27-year-old British actress stunned in a chic black dress adorned with a statement neckpiece as she attended the 90th Academy Awards event – but all eyes were on the new 'Time's Up' inking adorning her arm. Emma has been a leading figure in the fight for gender equality, and recently donated £1million to a fund for victims of sexual harassment. But is her new tattoo real? It seems most likely that the cursive writing is a temporary transfer, given that Emma has no other visible tattoos. But she certainly turned heads with her 'body inking' as she arrived for the star-studded ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fbcc1b4f781c-emma-watson-tattoo-2018-oscars-z.jpg><p id=eqMmkq6rw4wY data-wc=11><strong>Emma Watson unveiled a Time's Up 'tattoo' at the 2018 Oscars</strong></p><p id=exovp5NJ1JJv data-wc=105>Last month, Emma spearheaded a new UK arm of the Time's Up movement with the aim of fighting the anti-discrimination battle in Britain. Emma donated £1million to the fund, which has been publicly supported by around 200 stars of film, TV and stage, including <a class=hm-link href=#>Tom Hiddleston</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Keira Knightley</a>, who have each donated £10,000 to the cause. The Harry Potter star has been a steadfast supporter of women's interests and a supporter of the Time's Up movement since its inception. In 2014 she was appointed UN Women Goodwill ambassador, and that same year helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate gender equality.</p><p id=eN9QndlvXghv><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Emma Watson 'splits' from boyfriend William 'Mack' Knight after two years of dating</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/07ca96dfcc17-emma-watson-times-up-tattoo-2018-oscars-z.jpg><p id=eTUYb2i7I6fE data-wc=12><strong>It's not clear whether the tattoo is real or a temporary transfer</strong></p><p id=eO06hcHhWnaf data-wc=50>The 2018 Oscars was a star-studded affair with Hollywood stars including <a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a>, Meryl Streep, Margot Robbie and Sandra Bullock among the leading ladies in attendance.
