Cinema audiences got their first glimpse of the child star in Disney's 1998 comedy The Parent Trap, after she beat Scarlett Johansson to the roles of the Winsome twins who reunite their estranged father and mother.</p><p id=euM0Q85FMrK data-wc=52>The Disney producers who had cast her in The Parent Trap were so impressed they had already signed her up for a multi-picture deal. The result was 2003's body-swap comedy Freaky Friday, with Jamie Lee Curtis, quickly followed by Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen and Herbie: Fully Loaded in successive years.</p><p id=eyChyxCbJcA data-wc=59>In 2004, aged 18 she made her breakthrough performance as Cady Heron in the cult-adored film Mean Girls. The smart, adolescent comedy pulled in $67 million at the box-office, and earned her the title of reigning teen queen. &nbsp;She confirmed her position as the ultimate teen icon by becoming the youngest ever person to host the MTV Movie Awards.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejkoVgABhEl data-wc=57>Meanwhile, between modelling for Vogue and releasing a platinum-selling pop album, Speak, she had little time for normal adolescent pursuits. As her profile rocketed, the auburn locks were replaced by a blonder image and a wardrobe of cool-girl outfits which came in handy for stepping out with high-profile pals such as the Hilton sisters and Kimberley Stewart.</p><p id=eGi5u9nuu2E data-wc=74>Determined to recapture the success of the early days of her career after multiple substance abuse issues, Lindsay took on guest roles in US comedy Ugly Betty, appeared as a guest judge on Project Runway, and proved her fashion credentials by launching her own leggings line, 6126. She followed this with her own fake tan products, and a new job as artistic adviser to Emanuel Ungaro. The actress and Ungaro parted ways soon after.</p><p id=eiR44bvsL3W data-wc=23>She appeared in Liz & Dick and The Canyons, and then filmed the docu-series Lindsay in 2014 under the guidance of Oprah Winfrey.</p><p id=eL73Qo9aLz data-wc=38>After opening beach clubs in Greece, they became the backdrop of the MTV reality series Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club&nbsp;released in 2019. She then treturned to acting and starred in the Netflix romcom Falling for Christmas in 2022.</p><p id=emWH62yzp59 data-wc=24>In February 2023, she made a surprise appearance at New York Fashion Week, sporting a stunning copper outfit to match her signature auburn locks.</p><h2><strong>Personal life</strong></h2><p id=e2M-d1w6N8 data-wc=26>Her mother Dina was a Broadway dancer and her father Michael was a former Wall Street trader who made it big with his family-run pasta business.</p><p id=e4a2KksyYq data-wc=49>Romantically, she was previously linked to pop singer Aaron Carter and That 70s Show actor Wilmer Valderama, as well as movie stars Colin Farrell and Bruce Willis. In 2008, she embarked upon a romance with DJ Samantha Ronson, but their volatile relationship came to an end in April 2009.</p><p id=eExLk06oT5u data-wc=36>In 2022 she married financier Bader Shammas and in July 2023 she gave birth to her first baby, a boy named Luai who was born in Dubai.
