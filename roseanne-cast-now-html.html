For the cast of&nbsp;<a href=#>Roseanne</a>, most fans were likely familiar with the actors’ ongoing work because many have enjoyed successful entertainment careers in the years since <a href=#>the sitcom ended</a>. But for some of the stars, the show’s spinoff, The Conners, offered a chance to get back in the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_6>Here’s where the&nbsp;Roseanne cast wound up.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Roseanne-cast-now.jpg><p id=par-3_46>Premiering in 1988,&nbsp;Roseanne was ahead of its time in many ways. While the series had the veneer of a lighthearted, comedic — sometimes slapstick-like — family show, it was unafraid to plunge into darker moments. Serious topics included depression, poverty, drug use, health crises, and politics.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_38>In addition,&nbsp;Roseanne offered something unique: a working-class family that lived an average existence relatable to many of its viewers. While many sitcoms are set in luxurious cities with <a href=#>impossibly expensive apartments</a>,&nbsp;Roseanne offered a down-to-earth take on the genre.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-roseanne-barr-has-been-mired-in-controversy>Roseanne Barr has been mired in controversy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_37>As the show’s title character, Roseanne Barr became synonymous with her fictional portrayal of Roseanne Conner. Beloved as the sarcastic, wisecracking matriarch, Barr has unfortunately alienated many fans in the years since the series ended in 1997.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_53>The actor has drawn ire and consequences for her bizarre commentary <a href=#>rooted in right-wing conspiracy theories</a>&nbsp;and even got blacklisted from the Roseanne revival series&nbsp;after a racist tweet.
