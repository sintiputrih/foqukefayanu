If you’re unfamiliar with the basic concept, they explore in a world menaced by colossal Kaiju monsters that emerge from the oceans.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Mankind is facing an extinction-level event, though the tide is turned with the development of Jaegers, building-sized giant robots with the weaponry and armor needed to bash the Kaiju into submission. In an interesting twist, each Jaeger is driven by two pilots connected by a neural link, and they need to be emotionally synchronized to fight effectively.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>So, if your curiosity is piqued, here’s every Pacific Rim story to date in chronological order.</p><h2 id=h-pacific-rim-2013 data-injectable=false>Pacific Rim (2013)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Guillermo del Toro has always walked a fine line between blockbusters and prestige pictures, but Pacific Rim very definitely leans towards the blockbuster end of the spectrum. The introduction to the Pacific Rim world is seen through the eyes of Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), who must team up with Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) under the careful tutelage of Idris Elba’s Stacker Pentecost (who recently appeared on our ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dumbest character names</a>‘ list).</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Del Toro is clearly having a good time bashing his toys together, and his trademark attention to detail when it comes to special effects and CGI means this still looks great to this day. Pacific Rim is part of the DirecTV and ViX streaming libraries and can be digitally purchased or rented from all the usual places.</p><h2 id=h-pacific-rim-uprising-2018 data-injectable=false>Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Though Pacific Rim didn’t exactly set the box office alight it did well enough for a sequel. Uprising arrived five years after the original and featured a new cast of characters led by John Boyega as Jake Pentecost (son of Stacker).</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>With Pacific Rim having closed the breach through which Kaiju menaced our world, the threat in Uprising is often other Jaegers. This spirals into revelations about what’s actually controlled each Jaeger, perhaps inevitably resulting in the return of the actual Kaiju.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Much bashing and smashing follows though the film ends with a tease that the war between mankind and kaiju is just beginning. But, at least for now, Uprising is the final cinematic live-action entry in the franchise, as it didn’t meet box office expectations.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>Pacific Rim: Uprising is available to stream as part of the DirecTV library, and available to buy and rent from the usual online outlets.</p><h2 id=h-pacific-rim-the-black-2021-2022 data-injectable=false>Pacific Rim: The Black (2021 / 2022)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>Uprising failing to launch at the box office may have scuppered Pacific Rim in multiplexes, but not on Netflix. In 2021 Pacific Rim: The Black season 1 arrived on Netflix. This is a Japanese-American co-production produced by del Toro and set after the events of the films.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>Much of the action is set in Australia, which is now overrun by Kaiju. We follow siblings Hayley and Taylor Travis, who are trapped in the desert after their Jaeger pilot parents disappear. Naturally giant robot combat soon ensues, with the first season seeing the pair master a Jaeger known as Atlas Destroyer.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Season two also pushes the boundaries of what a Kaiju can be and, in a very Neon Genesis Evangelion-style twist, it transpires that they can take human form if they need to. Whether you’re a Pacific Rim fan or just like seeing animated robots punching monsters in the face The Black is a fun ride, with critics concluding it’s a worthy successor to the movies.</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false>Both seasons of Pacific Rim: The Black are available on Netflix.</p><h2 id=h-other-releases data-injectable=false>Other releases</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>If you still haven’t had your fill there are several Pacific Rim novels out there that flesh out the world. These are Tales from Year Zero, Man, Machines and Monsters, Tales from the Drift, Ascension, Blackout, Amara, and Aftermath. All are firmly in the Young Adult reading category but are canon to the wider story.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>There was also a Pacific Rim game on Xbox 360 that adapts the first movie, though this has long been unavailable to purchase online and is relatively rare in hard copy format. Mobile battler Breach Wars is also now long gone, as the servers were deactivated in September 2020.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>Finally, and most obscurely, there’s Pacific Rim: Extinction, a tabletop board game funded by a successful Kickstarter campaign that was released in 2018.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>And that’s it for all things Pacific Rim. As of 2023, the franchise is dormant, though we’d love to see it return someday. Guillermo del Toro has the clout, so maybe one day he’ll return and bring it back in style… perhaps even in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a crossover with Legendary’s MonsterVerse</a>? We can but dream.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXaWupLXFoppmqpmieq671aKcrGWRo7FuwNVmqqGnp6h6qrqMqKmdnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
