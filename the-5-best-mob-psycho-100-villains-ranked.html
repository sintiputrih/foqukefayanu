Recommended Videos Of course, heroes always need villains to balance the stories that are being told. And while some villains have tragic backstories that made them into who they are, others may have only had a single occurrence that veered them down the path of villainy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And while some villains have tragic backstories that made them into who they are, others may have only had a single occurrence that veered them down the path of villainy.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>The role of every great villain is to push the hero into learning and growing. Villains are fun to watch because they are so flawed, and it often makes them feel more real than the heroes.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>On the other hand, heroes may not always be perfect, but part of their growth process is making mistakes and choosing a better path – a path the villains were faced with and ultimately chose a different route. Today, we’re counting down some of the villains that have really put Mob to the test. Like any good hero, Mob helped most of these villains eventually change their ways.</p><h2 id=h-5-dimple data-injectable=false>5.

He was able to somehow survive being attacked by Mob, leaving him looking like Slimer from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghostbusters</a>.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Slimer now acts like the proverbial devil on Mob’s shoulder, but is really waiting for the right opportunity to possess the powerful teenage psychic. Even though he has helped Mob on numerous times, he still wants to take over the world.</p><h2 id=h-4-ishiguro data-injectable=false><strong>4.

A powerful esper, Ishiguro believes the world should worship him.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>His powers include telekinesis, gravity manipulation powerful enough to create black holes, powerful tackle and punch, and a finishing move called a two-ton guillotine in which he uses his combined strength with his gravity manipulation to decapitate his opponents. Intense stuff.</p><h2 id=h-3-ryo-shimazaki data-injectable=false><strong>3. Ryo Shimazaki</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Ryo Shimazaki is a powerful member of the Ultimate 5 and has convinced himself that he is one of the most powerful psychics. His huge ego is matched by his abilities, which includes teleportation, telekinesis, and extrasensory perception. Despite being blind, he can also see a person’s aura, allowing him to see the power within his opponents.</p><h2 id=h-2-keiji-mogami data-injectable=false><strong>2. Keiji Mogami</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Although he’s an extremely powerful evil spirit, Keiji Mogami was once known as the Greatest Psychic of the 20th Century. Facing a life of poverty and starvation while his mother was ill, Keiji would use his psychic powers to help people. After she died and began haunting him, he lost all faith in humanity and eventually ended his own life so that he could return as an evil spirit.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>With a tragic story like Keiji Mogami has, it’s really no wonder he became a villain. Faced with the same circumstances, his story makes the viewers believe that anyone could become a villain.</p><h2 id=h-1-toichiro-suzuki data-injectable=false><strong>1 .

Batman has the Joker, Spiderman has the Green Goblin, and Mob has Tōichirō Suzuki. Most of the time, it seems that when a hero has met their match, it’s usually because the villain shares similar qualities to the hero. Which, in the case of Mob, it’s Tōichirō Suzuki, also known as Claw.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Like different sides of the same coin, Mob and Claw share the same abilities. But unlike Mob, who has genuine integrity, Claw doesn’t care about anyone around him, including his own son, as he strives for world domination.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Claw shows the viewers what Mob could become if he ever goes dark, and that makes him one compelling villain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55lZWKvpr%2FTZqSoml2lwLqvx6hkamhgYsOquMuaoKerXaeur7fEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
