"You know, mom and pop, a couple married trying to make a business and family work and how we navigate that. I think what also made the show successful is that people do see themselves, their family, their personal struggles, their humor, and their way of dealing with things. So that allows us to peel back the layers a bit.”</p><p>Viewers are already huge fans of the Jackson-Sherrod family and we expect love and support to grow as the show continues.</p><p>Watch new episodes of Married to Real Estate on Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zvsiem2asn2K%2Fpq3LZpysrJGpsm6wzqA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
