She is excited about the chance to fall in love again and can’t wait for her Bachelor journey to begin!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Kimberly also appeared in a teaser video for The Bachelor 2023, where she discussed her perfect first date. “The perfect first date for me would be facing our fears together and&nbsp;<a href=#>doing something adventurous</a>,”&nbsp;the Bachelor contestant revealed.</p><h2>How old is Kimberly Gutierrez, and what does she do for a living?</h2><p>While Kimberly Gutierrez’s ABC bio lists her home as Los Angeles, CA, her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Linkedin</a> profile states that she works as a VIP Client Concierge Manager for Fabel Restaurants in Miami, FL.

Though we don’t know much about Kimberly’s limo entrance, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reality Steve</a> writes that she makes it to week 2. Kimberly then joins a group date that involves some kind of puppet show.</p><p>“Kimberly had an angel puppet and a devil puppet (like she had both of them sitting on her shoulder talking to her). She was talking about the first night coming out of the limo. And the angel would tell her nice things, and the devil would say things to make her insecure,” the spoiler guru wrote.</p><p>“The angel would say things like that she looked great and deserved to be there. The devil would say everyone else was prettier and she didn’t deserve to be there. Basically, a message about being confident in yourself.”</p><p>The Bachelor&nbsp;Season 27 premieres on Jan. 23, 2023, on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2BoZZmoeqy1zJucq6SpYriqucyyZKCtpJ6ys77Es2SrnZGhequ7wWagp6uklrSzrcxmmKecXZa0pnnOn2SzmZOderS0wKWjnKqfqMC0ecKaqq1lnZq6o7HRZqCnZWJlf3R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
