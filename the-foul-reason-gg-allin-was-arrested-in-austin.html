But if you were at a GG Allin show, you would have likely wanted to take multiple long baths because of his penchant for relieving himself on his audiences — not unlike that <a href=#>Brass Against incident from late 2021</a>, but definitely not a one-off in Allin's case. He'd also take a dump onstage and throw his poop at concertgoers, and that was the exact reason why the law got involved following a chaotic show at the Cavity Club in Austin, Texas, on February 18, 1992.</p><p>According to the official <a href=#>arrest report</a>, Allin's arresting officer initially responded to reports that a fight was taking place at the Cavity Club and that "a white male was on stage nude and was defecating" — no prizes if you correctly guess who that white male was. The officer immediately noticed that Allin was naked and bleeding from the forehead, and while being questioned, the controversial musician clarified that the on-stage pooping was part of his act, and so was his self-inflicted forehead wound.</p><p>Apparently, Allin wasn't the only source of chaos on that night, according to fellow musician Cris Burns. "This one punk rock guy was running up to all the cop cars, and he was peeing on the handles!" he told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Austin Chronicle</a>.&nbsp;"An ambulance rolls up the street, and the show is over by this point. The EMTs and the cops take GG out and put him into the ambulance, like it was his private limo or something. And he rolls off."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDlm5tam9fqbWmecWorKVlopqutLvNZp6gZZGhuaq6jLCYrGWRp7%2Bmv9Oem2ahnmKutr%2FToqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
