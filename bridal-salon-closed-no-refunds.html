If you grew up thinking about your wedding day and planned on wearing a wedding dress, you’ve likely daydreamed about what the “perfect dress” would look like on your special day. What you probably didn’t consider, however, is just how expensive the process can be."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During the video, Amanda posted the retailer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I Do Bridal Boutique</a>’s statement confirming they were closing its Fort Wayne location. The statement read that I Do was closing due to “obstacles in the wedding industry” they could not “overcome.”</p><p>I Do also promised to make “every effort” they could to ensure that all of the brides who had dresses in their store had them delivered in time for their weddings. However, the boutique advised those who had a dress “on order” to “please review your credit card terms for possible refunds. The retailers added that brides who planned to alter their dresses with I Do would be contacted directly by the store.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by I Do Bridal Boutique (@idobridalboutiquefw)</a></p></figure><p>Amanda also said she felt “so bad” for the brides affected by I Do’s closing.

When she arrived at I Do to find a dress, she couldn’t find one that fit the “snow queen” aesthetic she was trying to achieve for her winter wedding.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Eventually, Amanda bought a dress from I Do Boutique out of obligation since she already had a gift card at the boutique.

After selecting her dress, she said I Do began showing more “fishy” behavior, including giving her the run around on when she could expect her dress.</p>Article continues below advertisement<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Several fellow brides shared similar experiences to Amanda’s.</h2><p>In the second part of her two-part horrifying dress experience, Amanda said I Do held her dress for months, first telling her it would be ready by the end of July, then the “beginning of August,” and then finally stating it would arrive at “the end of August.”</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Once the end of August came, Amanda tracked the dress and discovered it was at her post office and was being held over the weekend. Eventually, she and her mother, who paid for the dress, picked it up after waiting for it for several months.</p><p>Although she had the dress, Amanda said she still had to take it through alterations, which took another “two months” before her wedding.
