And then once my son came into the world, I felt like I had a whole new reason to live and to stick around. And this song is talking about a woman, but for me, it’s more to my son than it is to a woman,” Wallen said on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Country Countdown USA</a> according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Country Now</a>.</p><p id=par-5_20>During an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET Canada</a>, Wallen once again confirmed that “Dying Man” is about Indie in his mind.</p><p id=par-6_26>“That’s just a song that hints on the idea that someone or something, you know, gave you a reason to keep living,” Wallen told ET Canada.</p><p id=par-7_42>He continued, “I mean, I was never, like, thinking I was going to die or anything, but it’s just, it’s geared towards my son.
