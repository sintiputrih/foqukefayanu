However, she may be better known as the wife of Panic! at the Disco vocalist and multi-instrumentalist <a rel=nofollow href=#>Brendon Urie</a>. Even though her husband is the lead singer of a famous rock band, Sarah has managed to build a significant following on social media using her array of skin care and beauty tips, as well as product promotions. She is also an active philanthropist, and regularly attends fundraisers with Brendon.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education_Growing_Up_in_Detroit>Early Life and Education: Growing Up in Detroit</span></h2><p>Born into an American family of part-Polish extraction, there is no conclusive information about her early life nor about her family, except that she has an older brother named Steve. This is a clear sign that she is devoted to her career as a social media personality and that she doesn’t want her private life interfering with her career. As for her education, there is no available information that can tell us something about her expertise, nor about the skills she possesses. While Sarah spent most of her childhood and youth in Detroit, she eventually moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dream of becoming an actress. While she thought LA would give her significant opportunities in terms of employment, she found something completely different.</p><h2><span id=Living_on_the_West_Coast_Looking_for_Work_and_Something_Else>Living on the West Coast: Looking for Work and Something Else</span></h2><p>Upon moving to the West Coast, Sarah had a hard time getting used to the hectic lifestyle of Los Angeles. A kid from the mid-west, she’d never lived in a city even remotely as big as her new place of residence. Regardless, she attended auditions and worked hard to establish herself in the acting world. She didn’t have much luck in the beginning, and only managed to appear in a few plays and independent movies with restricted circulatation. Around 2008 or 2009, she was in a relationship with Jeremy Davis, the then-bass player for the rock band Paramore, which seemed stable relationship and they even contemplated marriage, until something unexpected happened.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tumblr_nwyf8lZwVl1smqy3bo1_1280-819x1024.jpg></p><h2><span id=Meeting_Her_Future_Husband>Meeting Her Future Husband</span></h2><p>An avid rock music fan, Sarah was delighted by the fact that she could see all her favorite bands on an almost-weekly basis. Panic! At the Disco was always one of her favorite groups and she had the opportunity to see them live in concert in 2011, and managed to sneak into the backstage area with one of her friends. While hanging out in the musicians’ area of the venue, she approached Brendon Urie and chatted with him for a bit before asking for a photo, after which he asked her for her number. A few days later, they went out and immediately clicked. It was a match made in heaven, but the two decided to stay friends because she wasn’t single. However, it didn’t take them long to enter a relationship, on which tabloids reported, causing quite a lot of controversy in the media.</p><h2><span id=From_a_Rough_Start_to_an_Ideal_Couple>From a Rough Start to an Ideal Couple</span></h2><p>It was revealed that Sarah was with Jeremy Davis at the time she went out with Urie. She confirmed the allegations, but had the following to say: ‘Listen, I know everyone is going to judge me but things happen. The important thing is that Brendon knew about the situation and that we’re together now.’ Sarah left Jeremy Davis and was ready to commit to Brendon. Things were going fast and the two quickly fell in love, became engaged in 2011, and tied the knot on 27 April 2012, at the renowned Saddlerock Ranch in Malibu, California. Around 100 of their closest friends and family members attended the ceremony, while the newly-weds had their first dance to the soothing rhythm of the song “Faithfully”, an old hit by Journey.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy 3 year wedding anniversary, my handsome. ❤️ <a rel=nofollow href=#>@brendonurie</a> ❤️ <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/Z1sHvxVaxi</a></p><p>— Sarah Urie (@hellosarahurie) <a rel=nofollow href=#>April 27, 2016</a></p><h3><span id=Supporting_Brendons_Pansexuality>Supporting Brendon’s Pansexuality</span></h3><p>In a 2018 interview with <a rel=nofollow href=#>PAPER Magazine</a>, Brendon revealed that he is indeed pansexual. ‘I’m married to a woman and I’m very much in love with her but I’m not opposed to a man because to me, I like a person. You could say I’m pansexual’. Many fans and tabloids slandered Brendon for this interview, but Sarah stood by his side. She obviously knew about her husband’s affinities and wanted to be with him, despite the fact that he can be attracted to men.</p><h2><span id=Her_Career>Her Career</span></h2><p>Sarah is popular mostly because of her Instagram activity. She posts beauty and fashion advice on a regular basis, which garnered a lot of interest from fans around the world. A self-proclaimed organic product proponent, Sarah also posts a lot of reviews about popular skin-care products. She’s even sold aromatic soaps and various types of cleansers on her social media pages. Given the fact that she’s one of the most popular Instagram influencers, many brands have sponsored her, so providing an opportunity for her to earn more income. Sarah also gained fame on Vine, a now-defunct video sharing platform – her compilations had millions of views and were shared across the internet. Aside from this success on Vine, Sarah has one acting credit to her name, appearing in “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Good Cops</a>” in 2013, as Crow Ninja.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_How_Tall_is_Sarah_Orzechowski>Body Measurements: How Tall is Sarah Orzechowski?</span></h2><p>Sarah Orzechowski is 5ft 8ins (173cms) tall, weighs around 127lbs (58kgs), and her vital statistics are 33-24-33.
