The 32-year-old Dog The Bounty Hunter star posted a series of Instagram pics — <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>WHICH YOU CAN SEE HERE</strong></a> — on June 20, killing it in a green bikini swimsuit, that showed off her amble cleavage and tight abs as she kneeled on a beach right at the shoreline. She shared three photos in total, including a side angle shot and two others, where she’s seen staring off away from the camera. She also clearly used a filter to help make the blue of the ocean and sky completely pop. Photo skills!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>She captioned the photos, “Looking everywhere for the f**ks I used to give…. 👀 🏖#IKnewHavingATeenWouldComeInHandy #milf$,” which may or may not be a reference to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her ongoing feud</a> with stepmother <strong>Beth Chapman</strong>. As we previously reported, Lyssa, who is the ninth of <strong>Duane “Dog the Bounty Hunter” Chapman</strong>‘s 12 kids, &nbsp;didn’t wish Beth a Happy Mother’s Day last month, despite the fact that she’s battling throat cancer. Beth made their feud public on May 23, when she tweeted, “I’m very disappointed today. Knowing that not only did my daughter @BabyLyssaC not acknowledge me on Mother’s Day yet texted some of my friends wishing them a HMD She decides to exclude her dad and I from ABBIES graduation On Friday I would have moved a mountain to be there.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>On May 25, Lyssa posted a photo of her 17-year-old daughter Abbie’s high school graduation to her Instagram and a fan wrote in the comments, “Seriously unimpressed that you didn’t think or wish a happy mother’s day to Beth. Very disappointed in you young lady.” The reality star<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> fired back</a> at the fan, saying: “Seriously you don’t know s*** so MYOB also idgaf what you think.” In a since deleted tweet to Beth, she also wrote, “I have been so busy being a mom; celebrating, supporting and loving my daughter on the eve of her graduation, I haven’t had time to respond to you. @MrsdogC. You know you’re not blocked. I spoke to dad yesterday.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/By8rLEugkL_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>While most fans just told Lyssa how hot she looked in the recent beach selfies, some seemed to reference her feud with Beth in the comments. “Absolutely Gorgeous AND Strong all in one! I stopped giving a f**k about people’s bullshit drama and backstabbing a long time ago. Hope you and your beautiful family are all doing well,” a user named Albert told her. However, another was still upset with how she acted towards Beth, telling her “You have lost what class you had. You’re a mother and a daughter and you act like neither.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH13e5FpZqWxo6iubq%2FHmqemmZ5ir6q3yKegZqiZmMBussSum2arpJq9rrvMZpmerJhisbCzjK2fnmWSpMKvwNhmn66mpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
