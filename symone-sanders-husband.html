Symone married Shawn Townsend on July 15, 2022 at the Larz Anderson House in Dupont Circle in Washington D.C. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> actually covered their wedding (<a href=#>literal goals</a>) and went into detail about how they met!</p><p>The couple first met in April of 2019 when they were introduced by former South Carolina legislator and political analyst Bakari Sellers.

Vogue reported that Symone's "original wedding dress wouldn’t fit because her measurements weren’t taken properly." She ended up buying something off-the-rack that somehow still "fit like a glove."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> also shared some of Symone and Shawn's vows. At one point, Shawn said, "It’s the moments behind closed doors that we’ve shared… whether it’s me complaining about <a href=#>Real Housewives</a>, a political debate, or photobombing my Zoom calls. It is all time well spent together."</p><p>In her vows, Symone said, "To put it simply, you’re the best man I know... I will always be here for you. I’m very grateful just for everything that you are. You have always just been the most thorough person. You are so kind. You are so loving.”</p><p>We're not crying, you're crying.
