He had his education at Maury High School and played at the University of Maryland.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Joe Smith was the College Player of the Year at Maryland in 1995 and the No. 1 pick of that season’s NBA draft, picked by the Golden State Warriors. He was named to the 1995–96 All-Rookie team. Smith was mobile throughout his career, as he was one of the most traded players in league history.</p><p>In 1998, Smith was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers; he then played for the Minnesota Timberwolves (with a midway pitstop for the Detroit Pistons) until 2003. He later played for the Milwaukee Bucks, the Denver Nuggets, the 76ers again, the Chicago Bulls, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Atlanta Hawks, the New Jersey Nets, and the Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p>Smith was on the active roster of 12 different teams, which was an NBA record shared with Jim Jackson, Tony Massenburg, Chucky Brown, and Ish Smith, until Ish played with the Denver Nuggets, his 13th team, in the 2022–23 season.</p><h2><strong>Joe Smith Children: Does Joe Smith have kids?</strong></h2><p>Joe Smith is a proud father. He had a relationship with a beautiful lady called Yolanda Smith in the early 2000s and got divorced in 2011. During their time together, they had a son. Joe Smith’s son is named Amir Smith.</p><p><a href=#>Joe Smith’s</a> son, Amir Smith, was born in September 1997 and followed his dad’s footsteps to becoming a basketball player. He now plays professional basketball in Europe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>Joe Smith Professional Career</strong></h2><p>In the 1995 NBA draft, Smith was selected by the Golden State Warriors as the first overall pick, behind fellow power forwards Kevin Garnett, Antonio McDyess, and Rasheed Wallace, as well as guard Jerry Stackhouse.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>On November 30, 1995, Smith scored the highest single-game point total of his rookie season, with 30 points in a 125-121 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On January 20, 1996, Smith grabbed a career-high 20 rebounds while also scoring 21 points during a 110-102 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>At the end of the year, after starting all 82 games, Smith was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 1995–96 season and finished third in the Rookie of the Year voting to Damon Stoudamire and Arvydas Sabonis.</p><p>The following season, Smith would average a career-best 18.7 points per game, second on the team only to Latrell Sprewell’s 24.2 points per game. On January 8, 1997, Smith scored a career-high 38 points in a 109-95 loss to the Vancouver Grizzlies.</p><p>For the second season in a row, however, the Warriors would again miss the postseason, this time with a 30-52 record. Smith would play two and a half years for the Warriors before being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers with Brian Shaw for Clarence Weatherspoon and Jim Jackson midway through the 1997–98 season.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The trade was engineered by Golden State as Smith had made clear his desire to return to the East Coast and was approaching free agency (halfway through the final year of his 3-year rookie contract). Smith turned down a multi-year, $80 million contract with the Warriors. He made a reported $61 million over his career.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC2zp5krKWZqbVur8eio52qlaN6rrHErWShoaNiwLC6jJqkoqpdqLqqwMdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
