I could advance this whole thing, but I don’t want to tell people I’ve done cocaine so now I can’t advance it because of that. They all end up being little roadblocks along the way.”</p><p>The episode was recorded before the Hit and Run star revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had relapsed on opioids </a>during his 16-year sobriety journey. Shepard got candid about his struggles on the September 25 episode of his “Armchair Expert” podcast.
