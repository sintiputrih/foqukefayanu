For other Japanese holdouts, the war would go on for decades.</p><p>During the war, Japan had sent troops to almost every inhabitable island in the Pacific with the single charge of defending the Emperor and his territory with their lives. Some soldiers were so cut off from civilization that they either did not know that the war was over or they simply refused to believe it.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-8893 alt="Leaflet Asking Japanese Holdouts To Surrender" width=700 height=446 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/japanese-holdouts-surrender-leaflet.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-8893 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Source: Dobrinkman.net</a></p><p>In Guam, Indonesia, and the Philippines especially, dozens of soldiers would continue to conduct guerrilla attacks against local military and police forces. Allied forces littered the jungles with leaflets like the ones above, but Japanese soldiers continued to fight. Some even volunteered to fight alongside Vietnamese and Indonesian independence movements well into the 50’s.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-8892 alt="Shoichi Yokoi" width=700 height=466 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/japanese-holdouts-shoichi-yokoi.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-8892 class=wp-caption-text>Source: Tocorre.com</p><p>Shoichi Yokoi went into hiding after the Battle of Guam in 1944; he survived in a cave for 28 years until being discovered in January 1972.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-8890 alt="Hiroo Onoda" width=700 height=523 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/japanese-holdouts-hiroo-onoda.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-8890 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Source: Surviving History</a></p><p>Hiroo Onoda was a young officer who held out in the Philippines with several others. They once had leaflets dropped on them with a surrender message from their commanding general, but it was dismissed as propaganda. Onoda surrendered in 1974 after his former commanding officer was flown from Japan to officially relieve him of duty.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-8894 alt="Teruo Nakamura" width=700 height=461 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/japanese-holdouts-teruo-nakamura.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-8894 class=wp-caption-text>Source: Tocorre.com</p><p>Teruo Nakamura survived with other holdouts in Indonesia until they allegedly tried to kill him in the 1950’s.
