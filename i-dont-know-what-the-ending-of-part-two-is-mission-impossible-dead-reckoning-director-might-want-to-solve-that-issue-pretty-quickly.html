Recommended Videos As a scribe, the filmmaker has either penned, contributed to, or polished countless projects and made them substantially better as a result, so production kicking off on the second half of his latest collaboration with Tom Cruise in spite of a conclusion not being settled on isn’t as much of a concern as it would be if we were talking about something like a comic book movie."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m not being evasive. I could tell you that I know what the end of Part Two is, but I can’t guarantee that that will be the ending when we get there. Tom and I never obsess about executing the plan. We always have a direction, we always have a place we’re going. In our trying to describe the process, in retrospect, it sounds as though what we do is just flying by the seat of our pants and making it up as we go along.</p><p>That’s not an accurate description. You are definitely flying in a direction, you’re definitely prepared. You couldn’t be that cavalier without somebody getting seriously physically hurt. These things are planned within an inch of their life. Along the way, we see a shiny object and go for it.”</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Cruise and McQuarrie haven’t given us a reason to doubt them yet, and having avoided the infuriating cliffhanger trope in Part One, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s no reason to doubt that its immediate successor won’t do the exact same thing </a>and leave audiences the world over thrilled with the end result.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooGacn6PBbrfNqK5mr5iWwW7Ax55knqaUnruoec6fZKmZoql6tcPOZqCsZZ2ewLS1zqdkoqWgpMC0tcGlnGaclZaxbr7EnKKoppmjtG6wyKucnKyfp3qutcahq2avkaPBbsDOZqqopKaaerW0wK1koqujqrJuvNGeq62xXabCqq%2FKpbBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
