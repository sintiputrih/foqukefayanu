In Episode 1008, viewers witnessed Nami renewing her confidence in her captain, a moment that many fans welcomed online. Fans also witnessed Chopper get the Ice Oni virus in Episode 1008, which is an issue since Chopper has to produce an antidote. The hunt for Apoo continues, further delaying and complicating Chopper’s research of an antidote. This article discusses the release date and time of One Piece Episode 1009, as well as where to view it and the predicted spoilers.</p><h2>One Piece Episode 1009 is set to continue the anime’s journey to the Onigashima raid’s conclusion.</h2><p>Fans may get a fair indication of what to anticipate in One Piece Episode 1009 by glancing over the manga chapter that the previous episode covered. Aside from a moment in which Wanda and Carrot eventually meet Perospero, Episode 1008 covered the whole of Chapter 995. In this missed part, Big Mom and Marco also leave the three and proceed to the live floor.</p><p></p><p>As a consequence, since these pages were unadapted in Episode 1008, Episode 1009 will most likely begin with this scene. Following this, Episode 1009 will most likely feature Yamato vs. Sasaki, as shown in Chapter 996. The episode’s title, Sasaki’s Onslaught – Armored Division vs. Yamato seems to corroborate this.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>One Piece Episodes 1006-1009 Titles:</p><p>1006: I Won’t Forgive You! Chopper’s Determination<br>1007: Zoro’s Pursuit! Ice Oni in Oni Tag.<br>1008: Nami Surrenders!? Ulti’s Fierce Headbutt<br>1009: Sasaki’s Onslaught – Armored Division VS Yamato</p><p>— YonkouProductions (@YonkouProd) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 8, 2022</a></p><p>According to the trailer for Episode 1009, it seems that Page one and Ulti vs Nami, Usopp, Otama, and Komachiyo will also be adapted. Franky vs. Sasaki should begin in 1009 as well, with the teaser showing Franky being pursued by Numbers member Hatcha.&nbsp;Shots of Trafalgar Law and Eustass Kid traversing Onigashima on their route to the rooftop are also likely to be featured. Law is searching for different Poneglyphs in order to discover more about D.’s Will, whilst Kid and Killer are intent on amassing as many weapons as possible.&nbsp;Although these two sequences were not included in the Program 1009 teaser, they should be featured in the episode itself.</p><h2>One Piece Episode 1009: Release Date, Time, and Where to Watch</h2><p>Episode 1009 is presently scheduled to be released on Saturday, February 5 at 9:00 p.m. EST. The episode will show on Japanese network TV at this time, and will afterward be accessible via Simulcast streaming sites like Funimation and Crunchyroll.&nbsp;Unfortunately, subscriptions to either streaming service are the only method for overseas fans to see the episode as soon as it airs in Japan. After some time, the episode will be accessible for free viewing with advertisements for free viewers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/One-Piece-1009-2.jpg alt="One Piece ep 1009" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In summary, One Piece Episode 1009 ultimately presents the Worst Generation and Yonko’s encounter on the roof, which manga fans refer to as “Roof Piece.” The separation of Big Mom and Marco from Perospero, as well as a supposed Law and Kid inclusion, creates the groundwork for the meeting.&nbsp;Aside from the plot, fans can anticipate the same excellent animation, audio, and voice acting as seen in the Onigashima raid and Wano arc. While the tempo has been a little sluggish in recent episodes, this is most likely to provide Toei more time behind the scenes to work on the impending “Roof Piece” segment.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGimp51dpbamr8RmnKmho6SxpnmQaWdyZaKauaat0p5knZmkmnqiusNmq6KllWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
