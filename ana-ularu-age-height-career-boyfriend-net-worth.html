The name of her parents is <strong>Mihaela</strong> and <strong>Nicolae</strong>. There is hardly any information on her siblings, though.

Some of the sources suggest that she is a single child. If it is the case, then well, she is highly pampered, and there was a pretty good bond in the family. The freedom to choose a career in acting is something that shows the liberal nature of the family.</p><p>For the educational background, though, there is hardly anything available.
