A source said at the time, “Khloé doesn’t have bad or negative feelings toward Tristan at this point. Being quarantined has made her have a soft spot for him, and she knows he will always be part of her life in some way because he is True’s dad. Khloé has been open and receptive toward Tristan.”</p><p>A second insider revealed in May that Kardashian and Thompson, who <a href=#>threw a joint Trolls-themed birthday party</a> for True a month prior, were “very much <a href=#>acting like a couple</a>” while self-isolating together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6vedOroKyskaN6tbTOpqesp55iubC7ymaaqLKpYq61ecWroJ6mlKh6sa3RrbBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
