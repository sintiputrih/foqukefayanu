Even if you never had any doubts about their relationship, you’ve got to admit that the pictures of Drake and Rosee were pretty surprising. The “One Dance” rapper took a solo trip to Amsterdam to hang out with a stripper. That’s not exactly what girlfriends want to hear. But Jen being SO confident and secure, didn’t mind at all! “Drake’s very open and upfront with JLo, plus, there were photographers at the dinner” capturing their every move, the source continues. “The last thing he wants is to ruin that beautiful connection they share.”</p><h3><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez’s Hottest Pictures Ever</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Drake and the bootylicious singer haven’t even been dating that long, but they’re already one of our favorite couples! WHY?! Because they’re also releasing music together! After weeks of speculation, JLo finally confirmed the collaborating rumors.&nbsp;“He just asked me to do a song with him and that’s what we’ve been doing,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>InStyle</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Jan. 18.&nbsp;“We’ll see if it’s on his next album.” With Drake’s swagger, and JLo’s&nbsp;killer dance moves, just think how epic their new tunes are going to be!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Jen wholeheartedly trusts Drake?
