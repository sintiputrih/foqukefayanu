I definitely grew, but I had ups and downs,” the Alabama native said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in March. “There were moments where I did not think this would happen. I think the reason I’m here is because I was real, I was myself and I showed every part of myself.”</p><p>Part of herself is what many call Hannah Beast – her headstrong side that will return on The Bachelorette.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I can’t wait to unleash the beast on some jabroni,” she said. “I would not have gone on this show if I hadn’t really thought about what was at the end of this.”</p><p>As for <a href=#>what she’s looking for</a>, Brown just wants to find a good, kind man: “Ultimately, I want at the end of this to know that they know me and know every part of me, not just some version of myself that I packaged together and was like, ‘Do you like this?’ I think I’ve done that in the past, the good and the bad, and I want that in return.”</p><p>The Bachelorette season 15 premieres on ABC Monday, May 13, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XrqS0xKWmq52kqbJuvNGopKhlmJa7r63HZpmrp6ejeqW105yfnqtdnbKzecKrprCmXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
