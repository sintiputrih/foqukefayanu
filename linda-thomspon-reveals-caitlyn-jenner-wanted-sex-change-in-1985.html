Thompson kept Jenner's bombshell a secret from everyone for decades: including their two children, Brandon and Brody.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am a woman trapped in a man's body," Jenner told Thompson back in 1985, to which Thompson replied: "Whoa, Bruce, honey, have you looked in a mirror? You are the epitome of the ideal man!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jenner explained: "I have lived in the wrong body my whole life. It is a living hell, and I really would like to move forward with the process of becoming a woman."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Thompson tried to process Jenner's revelation, the couple entered therapy to try to work through the issue to no avail.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thompson recalls, "As we tried to work through our feelings, Bruce told me he was considering traveling out of the country, possibly to Denmark, to try to have the gender reassignment surgery anonymously and then come back as a female. 'What about our children?'" she asked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jenner reportedly considered leaving his sons lives and re-entering as a female relative, "He was grasping for a lifeline. As devastated as I was, my heart bled for Bruce," Thompson writes in the new book.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While Jenner hoped the couple could stay married even after her transition, Thompson knew their relationship was over. She continued to keep Jenner's gender identity a secret from their sons Brandon and Brody until they were 31 and 29 years old, "I wanted them to experience enough life and garner enough knowledge, confidence and compassion to be able to deal with their father's true self."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thompson's memoir, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062469748/a-little-thing-called-life data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A Little Thing Called Life" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">A Little Thing Called Life</a>, will be available on August 23, 2016.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/765453da-3fc9-4650-8bff-01664371711e_1704808979.png alt="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" title="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Alexis Fisher is the Senior Editor at Cosmopolitan, overseeing digital content across fashion, lifestyle, beauty, sex, and culture.
