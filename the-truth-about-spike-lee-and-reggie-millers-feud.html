Possibly, Lee was aware that Cheryl used to always<a href=#>&nbsp;beat her brother</a> at one-on-one when they were kids and he chose to weaponize that truth. "It started with him and the Cheryl chants and 'Cheryl was better,'" Reggie told Patrick about his beef with Lee. "That's kind of what started it, and he got everyone around him involved ... I'm like, is he really saying this?" Yes, Reggie, he really was.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhjbYBxgo6tn55lpKfCtbSMmpmoraRiwLG1yp5kpZ2VYq6vsIyrnKCfmZp6rrXLpZyrq12bsrawjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
