Here are some highlights:</p><p>Ospreay: “Yeah, I mean, if you didn’t know about me, I guess that was the best way to introduce the first chapter in my New Japan story, just because I think me and Ricochet were like mirror images of one another and it was kind of like you’ve met your match, in a weird way. It was just, that’s the way I always see it. And I think that’s the best way to introduce because, if you’re gonna put Ricochet and Will Ospreay in the ring together, that’s the type of match you want to see. But the backlash was the main thing just because I didn’t think there was anything wrong with it, personally. I was like, this is what we just do on the indies. But, because it was on such a large scale, like we’ve never done it on this scale before, I think everyone had an opinion on it. It was a conversation that needed to be had and this was the right match to start that conversation, I guess.”</p><p>Ospreay: “Just because I don’t think there’s anything I like more. The stories in America compared to the stories in Japan are a completely different thing where like American storylines are like, “You kissed my girlfriend and now I’m mad!” Kind of more like a soap opera when the stories in Japan are more focused on the championship, and how I can become the best, and it’s like rankings in a weird way, and divisions and it’s more along the lines of mixed martial arts. I like that story more where it’s just like more you have a guy, and he goes through the tournament, he goes through the tournament, then he gets knocked down. Then, next year, he comes back again, a little bit more. And then, finally, when he wins the title, it’s almost like a crowning moment.”</p><p>Ospreay: “I’ve heard rumors that Paul Heyman told him to apologize to me and Paul Heyman is a big supporter of mine and, once again, Paul Heyman is Paul Heyman, you know what I mean? I heard that he told Seth to apologize so I don’t know if that’s true or not, but there’s kind of rumors going around backstage and like I’ve got guys who are friends with Seth Rollins in New Japan who have told me this, and I don’t know if that’s true but it sounds about right. I just don’t know. I’ve never met Seth at all, like ever. But I’ve always been a fan of him when he was in Ring of Honor and when he was doing stuff with Jimmy Jacobs and I don’t know. When he said that, at first, I didn’t think anything of it, I was just kind of like, ‘Ah whatever,’ like, ‘Whatever, he makes more money, good on him.’ And afterwards, reading it over and over again, I went, he kinda did sleight me off a bit, didn’t he? He just called me a s— version of Ricochet. I was feeling like, well that hurt. And then he was just kind of like,&nbsp; ‘Well I make more money than you.’ I was kind of like, that doesn’t make you better. No one’s better in wrestling, it’s wrestling, it’s a cooperative sport. So that’s why I’m kind of like, I don’t know how to feel about it because at the end of it, if someone apologizes to me, I just let it go.”</p><p>The full video interview is available below, and an audio version is also available on your preferred podcasting platform:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBxaXBuZGLEqrjLZqasqKKarrp5zqdknKVdpcKvt4ysnK2gXae8rbjIp6pmmZWseqK6w2akqKqV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
