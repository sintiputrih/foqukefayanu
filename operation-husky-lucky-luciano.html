They feared that these people may be sympathetic to the Axis cause and could pose a national security threat.</p><p>In 1942, suspicions began to focus on the Eastern seaports after the U.S. troop carrier ship the SS Normandie (which had been renamed USS Lafayette) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caught fire</a> and capsized while in harbor in Manhattan, an act that many believed to be the work of a saboteur.</p><p>In response, the government began to investigate many of the Italian-American dock workers who lived in the area. When this operation failed to bear fruits, the government sought help from an unlikely source: the <a href=#>Mafia</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146111 alt="The SS Normandie attack would lead to Operation Husky." width=900 height=602 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/normandie.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146111 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The SS Normandie, renamed USS Lafayette, on fire at New York harbor. Feb. 9, 1942.</span></p><p>The Navy, who was in charge of the operation, reached out to well-known Mafia boss Salvatore C. Lucania, better known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucky Luciano</a>. At the time Luciano was serving a 30-50 year sentence for compulsory prostitution at the Clinton Prison facility when the Navy offered him a deal; a reduction of his sentence for information and assistance in their operation. Luciano agreed.</p><p>Luciano ordered that any suspicious activity along the docks and waterfronts be reported to the authorities. Luciano also apparently guaranteed that there would be no strikes among the dock workers.</p><p>To this day the effectiveness of this operation, known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Underworld</a>, is debated. However, it should be noted that after 1942 no other ships were destroyed and there were no strikes among the New York City dock workers.</p><p>And that’s not where it stopped.</p><p>As the war raged on, the Allies began formulating their plans to invade Italy. The U.S. took the lead on the operation and quickly decided that the island of Sicily must be taken first. To help prepare for the invasion, the U.S. government called upon their old associates: Luciano and the Mafia.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-122116 alt="Benito Mussolini taps the cheek boy" width=550 height=373 data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mussolini-black-brigade-boy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-122116 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Benito Mussolini taps the cheek of a young boy in the Black Brigades. Brescia, Italy. 1945.</span></p><p>This made sense for a number of reasons. The Mafia weren’t fans of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Mussolini had brutally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cracked down</a> on the organization, essentially sending them into hiding. More importantly, though, Luciano and his associates had Sicilian contacts who would be able to provide the Americans with key information and logistical support needed for the invasion.</p><p>According to a report from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this was recommended as a precursor to the invasion. The report <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">advises</a> “Establishment of contact and communications with the leaders of separatist nuclei, disaffected workers, and clandestine radical groups, e.g., the Mafia, and giving them every possible aid”.</p><p>The U.S. government called upon these Mafia associates to provide drawings and pictures of the Sicilian coastline and harbors, which they promptly received in mass. This information was used to plan the Allied amphibious landing which commenced in July of 1943. Some of these Sicilian contacts even fought alongside the American forces against the Germans and Italians.</p><p>According to most accounts, Luciano was integral in facilitating this operation, codenamed Operation Husky, and even offered to personally go to Sicily to help the war effort. Thirty-eight days into the invasion, the Allies succeeded in driving the enemy out of Sicily, and the battle for Sicily was over.</p><p>To this day, the extent to which the assistance provided by Luciano and the Mafia helped in Operation Husky is hotly debated. Some, like syndicated columnist Walter Winchell, suggested that Luciano’s contributions to the war effort and Operation Husky were so extensive that he was being considered for the Medal of Honor.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146159 alt="Troops on the shores during Operation Husky." width=900 height=570 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/operation-husky-shores.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146159 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Troops from the 51st (Highland) Division unloading stores from tank landing craft on the opening day of Operation Husky.

In his book, Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America’s Mast Powerful Mafia Empires, Raab suggests that Luciano lacked the Sicilian contacts to make a substantial difference.</p><p>The truth most likely lies somewhere in the middle. According to a Luciano’s lawyer, his client “led to the locating of many Sicilian-born Italians who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave information of military value</a> on conditions in Sicily”, and that he “aided the military authorities for two years in the preliminaries leading to the invasion of Sicily”.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146115 alt="Lucky Luciano drinking wine." width=900 height=556 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lucky-luciano-drinking.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146115 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body> Lucky Luciano drinks a glass of wine.</span></p><p>Upon conclusion of the war in the summer of 1945, Luciano, who was still serving time behind bars, petitioned the state of New York for executive clemency. He insisted that his cooperation in both Operation Underworld and Operation Husky warranted his immediate freedom.</p><p>In January of 1946 New York Governor Thomas <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dewey granted Luciano’s appeal</a> for clemency. However, it was decided he could not stay in the U.S. and was to be deported back to Italy, where he was born. Luciano was apparently quite upset that he had to leave America, yet on Feb. 9, 1946, he was placed on a ship destined for Italy, never to return to the U.S.</p><p>Despite his exile, Lucky Luciano remained a powerful figure within the Mafia crime organization in both Italy and the U.S. until his death in 1962.</p><p>Enjoy this article on Lucky Luciano and Operation Husky?
