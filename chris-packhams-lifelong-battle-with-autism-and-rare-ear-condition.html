However, the condition is now 'retired' and is today considered and diagnosed as Level 1 Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p><p id=esMbI8QF1hH data-wc=41>Chris was also vocal about how he hopes that young people today receive diagnoses quicker than he did. "Clearly, I was in a lesser cohort than most other people, so I blamed myself for everything that was going wrong," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/996087947d9d-megan-mccubbin.jpg><p id=eresBryuqck data-wc=44>"Young people can't be in that position if they're going to work through education and find a fulfilling life, we need to put them on a firm foundation of confidence and support, and the diagnosis should be an access to that type of support.</p><p id=eER62QUAEgR data-wc=15><strong>"So it's not just about getting the diagnosis, it is about what follows from that."</strong></p><p id=e9O104YCs-dW data-wc=34>A diagnosis, Chris explained, is hugely important for people with ASD to receive relevant support, extra guidance and, ultimately, a level of comfort and confidence as they move through life with a neurological condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e315060307c8-chris-packham-2.jpg><p id=eACIffrrfVHF data-wc=26>"I know a few people now that I knew when I was diagnosed, and they say that it’s quite considerably changed me," the BBC broadcaster said.</p><p id=eGN9qMjcPOBQ data-wc=56><strong>"I'm much more confident to talk about my needs, my incapacities, and the things that I can do better. </strong>I will put myself forward if there's something which I am enabled to do by the condition. And I will be far more frank and honest about the disabling aspects of it, from my point of view."</p><p id=e93N-MMcKt1F data-wc=41>According to the NHS, people with ASD may act in a "different way to other people." Autistic people may find it hard to communicate and interact with other people and find it hard to understand how other people think or feel.</p><h2>What else is there to know about Chris Packham's health?</h2><p id=eXBXGEaxs-JD data-wc=50>In addition to discussing his ASD, Chris has also been very open about his journey with Ménière's disease, an inner ear condition he was diagnosed with in his late 30s. The condition results in Chris suffering from tinnitus and vertigo and previously left him in a state of "constant worry."</p><p id=ekX2URIBd3Kt data-wc=44>He told the Mirror in 2018: "There is a danger that the Ménière's which I suffered from in this ear could spread to the other one and I could lose my hearing in that ear as well. It's something that gives me constant worry."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e1c20f1b5c2b-chris-packham.jpg><p id=eKn3dXaqj7Tm data-wc=15>More recently, Chris revealed during an episode of that he is an insomniac.</p><p id=exdnJRTll8vY data-wc=51>"I can relate to it obviously, insomnia. I barely sleep, never slept well." He added: "I just don't spend much time unconscious. It's a waste of time, isn't it? Don't get much done do you? I always say sleep when you're dead and eat just before. It's one of my mantras."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
