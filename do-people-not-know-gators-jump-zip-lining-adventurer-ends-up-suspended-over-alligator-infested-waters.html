Others questioned why a ziplining business was even allowed to operate over an alligator-infested swamp.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>Several viewers pointed out that this whole setup was especially dangerous, seeing as alligators are actually quite the jumpers. One person even said that there are gator farms where they dangle meat about the gators to see how high they can jump. “Crazy how they are all coming towards something dangling in the air … maybe it’s cause they’re fully capable of jumping that high.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@kkma62 href=#>@kkma62</a><p><a title=crocodile href=#>#crocodile</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=tiktok href=#>#tiktok</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - kkma" href=#>♬ original sound – kkma</a></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>In case you can’t envision it, several people have posted viral videos of alligators’ ability to dance above the water and it appears they can jump their full body length. It is clear to see that a gator could easily jump up and grab a bird, dangled meat, or maybe a ziplining ankle.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Animal Research</a>, some gators can even jump up to heights of six feet, which is impressive seeing as they weigh anywhere from two hundred to a thousand pounds. Though they don’t often make jump attacks, the reptiles, which measure up to about eleven feet, have been responsible for nearly 400 attacks from 1948 to 2004, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to A-Z Animals</a>. While the yearly ratio isn’t crazy, it’s important to be aware of where gators may be and try to avoid invading their space, especially via zipline.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Next time you’re seeking adrenaline or wanting to try something new, there are plenty of options to choose from. Skydiving, parasailing, or rock climbing are all nice, alligator-free activities. And if you do decide that you absolutely must zip line to scratch that itch, maybe pick somewhere without gators. Preferably outside the state of Florida.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8pbuMqZyoqJyaeq%2B702aip6enYrSiwM6rqmaipaK9bsbIqWSloZ6eu6h5wJ2tnqakqr%2BmvoyepZ2rXaq9br%2FUrKeeppSasW671Z6pZpmcobaordOoqWahnpuytMDEnWSwmaSav7R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
