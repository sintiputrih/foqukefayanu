The singer-songwriter wanted to provide fans with a new song, and the collaboration with J-hope accomplished that perfectly.&nbsp;In an interview with MK Sports, the artist discussed the experience of recording Rush Hour with the BTS rapper. He praised Sunshine’s persistence and said that he insisted on re-recording to ensure that the song was faultless.</p><p>“j-hope worked so hard on recording that he was sweating heavily and didn’t even use the restroom.” J-hope kept saying, “Let me do it again,” throughout the tape. I’m capable of doing it better. “Please, one more time!”</p><p>CRUSH went on to say that BTS’ j-hard hope’s ethic demonstrated how he had attained unprecedented success. He stated:</p><p>“When I looked at him, I realized he isn’t where he is now for nothing, and I have a lot of respect for him as an artist.”</p><h2>CRUSH discusses his first time working with BTS’ j-hope.</h2><p>Nearly two years later, famed soloist CRUSH announced his return on September 19, 2022, with the digital song Rush Hour (with a j-hope of BTS). Everyone was taken aback by the news. Fans’ anticipation increased when it promised to combine two wonderful things in one song: CRUSH’s return and the appearance of the Daydream rapper. CRUSH addressed the relationship with MK Sports in an interview on September 22. He originally contacted BTS’s j-hope about collaborating. He went on to say:</p><p>“J-Hope and I had already discussed music extensively. While working on this new song, I discovered that the musical approach I was considering and the portions I identified with are comparable to those of J-Hope. So I proposed to J-Hope that we collaborate, and that’s how he accepted to participate by appearing [in the song].”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CRUSH-2.jpg alt=CRUSH width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say that BTS’s sunny rapper was most suited for Rush Hour. He went on to say that the two “developed synergy in many ways.”&nbsp;BTS’ j-hope not only sang in the song but also directed the music video. He also increased CRUSH’s energy when he was feeling low and assisted him in monitoring the production.</p><p>“J-hope even agreed to feature in the song video.” He remained by my side and attempted to cheer me up when I felt physically exhausted from shooting my dance moments. I was also appreciative for his assistance in monitoring and coaching.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CRUSH.jpg alt=CRUSH width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The song received excellent feedback from the crowd. The secret punch in the song video stunned people as well. The couple danced to the hook step of BTS’s Mic Drop in one of the chorus choreographies. Rush Hour (featuring BTS’s j-hope) was published on September 22, 2022, and it has already received 5.3 million views on YouTube.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaq62jnXq0tMCrnGagmah6psTPnqminZ6YsrR51qippKGenHq4tdOhZJuso2K3brTOqZxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
