"I miss him, and we'll just continue his legacy and do everything that he would want to do."</p><p>Jackson, 18, <a href=#>became the youngest competitor</a> on&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars in 2020, and on the Oct. 5 episode, she planned another tribute to her beloved co-star. According to<a href=#>&nbsp;Newsweek</a>, the Bunk'd star prepared a foxtrot to the John Legend song "Ordinary People" in Boyce's honor. It's unclear if that dance will get her through to the next round, but what is clear is the powerful relationship she shared with her Jesse co-star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21mboJ0e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2ouKK1jKOYnKOjpLturc2dZJyZnZq%2FsLqMm6aym5WoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
