The 27-year-old, who is best known for playing Desperate Housewives’ Andrew Van De Kamp — the openly gay and occasionally meddlesome son of conservative housewife Bree Van De Kamp (Marcia Cross) — revealed “against the advice of others” that he was “an alcoholic and a drug addict” who recently celebrated five months of sobriety."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Desperate Housewives alum<strong> Shawn Pyfrom</strong> penned a lengthy blog post on his <a href=#>official tumblr page</a> entitled, “something i must share…”&nbsp;</p><p>The 27-year-old, who is best known for playing Desperate Housewives’ Andrew Van De Kamp — the openly gay and occasionally meddlesome son of conservative housewife Bree Van De Kamp (Marcia Cross) — revealed “against the advice of others” that he was “an alcoholic and a drug addict” who recently celebrated five months of sobriety.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m relatively new to being sober, considering the scope of time that I’ve been an addict. But within that scope, this is also the longest I’ve been sober; since I began using,” he wrote. “I chose to share this about myself because I could not hear of another person being robbed of their life, due to addiction; knowing that I stayed quiet about mine.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I made a promise to myself that I would never stand as a preacher of sobriety — speaking from a podium that could be interpreted as arrogant or judgmental,” Pyfrom continued. “I have no judgement for the way anyone chooses to live their life. And I only have compassion for those who currently struggle with their addictions.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Since Desperate Housewives ended in 2012, the young star has appeared as a guest star on TNT’s Rizzoli & Isles and as Private John W. Nichols in the TV movie Killing Lincoln. In the tumblr post, he reveals that his substance abuse limited his professional opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>“For several years, I lived for drugs,” he continued. “I thought more about using, than I thought about any other ‘pleasures.’ I wasted the time of valuable people, who worked so hard to pull my career to a higher place, by allowing my addictions to tug me out of their grip.”&nbsp;</p><p>And while Hoffman’s death inspired his post, Pyfrom makes sure to note that the Oscar winner’s loss is no more significant than that of any other human being.&nbsp;</p><p>“When news reaches us of a public figure, like Mr. Hoffman, passing away form such a terrible affliction; we tend to get the feeling of great loss,” he noted. “It is a great loss. I feel grief when I hear of such a talented human being leaving this earth…but every life is important.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hoffman was found dead in the bathroom of his New York City apartment on Sunday, Feb. 2 after suffering from an apparent drug overdose at the age of 46. He is survived by his girlfriend <strong>Mimi O’Donnell</strong> and three young children.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans and celebrities alike have commended Pyfrom’s decision to open up about his own addiction. Pretty Little Liars star <strong><a href=#>Lucy Hale</a></strong> tweeted, “@shawn_pyfrom you are brave & strong. I admire your honesty, my friend,” and former Revenge actress <strong>Ashley Madekwe</strong> retweeted the blog post with the comment, “Brave boy.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGsu2682J%2BpqKVdmbK0vMSrmK2dXZ28tr%2FEsKCvnaNiv6bCxJqjrGWRmbGqr9Oipqdlo6m%2FtrPGpZysZZKhvKh5wJ%2BrnqpdpbWquMipZKydqaK8tr6Moaafnp2Wu7R5w56YraBdZ31ygJJrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
