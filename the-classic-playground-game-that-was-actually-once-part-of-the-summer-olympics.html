In these instances, two groups of people pulling on a rope or a piece of wood were part of religious ceremonies. Essentially anywhere there was rope and enough people to divvy up into teams, there's a good chance something reminiscent of tug of war was on display.</p><p dir=ltr>The ancient Greeks are credited with turning the idea into a strength competition, though sometimes it was used as more of a way for athletes, as well as warriors, to train for other sports than a contest in and of itself, per <a href=#>Sportsmatik</a>. Tug of war continued to spread and increase in popularity in places like 12th-century India. As the years went by, it continued to be a popular pastime.</p><p dir=ltr>In 1896, the first modern <a href=#>Olympic Games</a> were held, reviving the ancient Greek tradition, 1,500 years after the games had been banned by Roman Emperor Theodosius I (per <a href=#>History</a>).&nbsp;The first modern games were fittingly hosted in Athens, Greece, and just 13 countries participated. However, tug of war was nowhere to be found on the schedule for the 1896 Games and didn't make its Olympic debut until four years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFj2lqaW5fqbWmecKlmKyrmZh6sbjAsp6rp6WjsW6zwKacZqyYlsFuw8CsZJqbpKqurbjYZqanm5VivaK%2B02amn2WknbJuv9SmpJ6qXaS5urnPopqsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
