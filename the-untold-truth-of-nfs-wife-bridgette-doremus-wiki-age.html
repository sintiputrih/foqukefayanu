Following her graduation, she began learning more, and eventually discovered the site Instagram which has become a hub for many fitness models and enthusiasts. Wanting to establish a brand and business, she created the&nbsp;account&nbsp;Bridge_Fit.</p><p>Her following grew over the years, as she posted workout videos and tutorials. She also posted about lifestyle, and helped motivate many of her followers. She grew to have over 100,000 followers, with a lot of people also there because she was attractive. Eventually she established the fitness and lifestyle brand Stripped Fitness in 2013, and the brand’s popularity also surged after she began a relationship with NF. She continues to use Instagram as a lifestyle blog, while creating a YouTube&nbsp;channel&nbsp;that served more like a vlog with a few fitness workouts. She also started the lifestyle blog Halfway Hippie, which sells merchandise and other items.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=husband-%e2%80%93-nf></span>Husband – NF<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nathan John Feuerstein was born in Gladwin, Michigan on 30 March 1991, and was mainly raised by his mother, as his parents divorced when he was young – being involved in an abusive relationship, his mother took him away to live on their own. He attended Gladwin High School, but before he matriculated his mother passed away from a drug overdose, the result of a long-term addiction.</p><p>At around this time, he had looked to music as a means of escape his rough childhood. He used a karaoke machine to record instruments and use its mic to rap. He also showed talents in basketball, but not enough to pursue it professionally.</p><p>After high school, he started working in Canton, Michigan as a part of the Connection Church, where he became a member of the team that organized the Fine Arts Festival there. He continued to make and record music, and in 2010 released his debut album – “Moments” – independently, under his real name, and this led to him getting to know a few music producers, including Tommee Profitt.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=rise-to-fame-%e2%80%93-nf></span>Rise to Fame – NF<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>NF’s partnership with Profitt proved successful as after the release of his debut single “Alone”, he was noticed by the Xist Music team who began working with him, leading to the release of his debut extended play (EP) “I’m Free”, created with the help of Profitt.</p><p>The EP also featured the song “Alone”, and was released upon his re-branding to NF, coupled with the release of a self-titled EP, which was his last collaboration with the label due to disagreements. He continued releasing music, and working with other artists such as Shuree Williams and Danielle Swift.</p><p>In 2014 he&nbsp;signed&nbsp;with the Capitol Christian Music Group, his partnership timed perfectly with the breakthrough of his EP on Billboard. He quickly became a noticed artist in the rap, gospel, and Christian charts, and gained highly positive reviews for his work, and he soon began working on his first full studio album, “Mansion” which was another success.</p><p>Aside from regular music releases, he’s partnered with several video game companies to produce music for their soundtracks. Some of the companies’ games he’s worked on include “Apex Legends”, “Madden NFL 16”, and “MLB The Show 18”.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=recent-projects-%e2%80%93-nf></span>Recent Projects – NF<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Aside from video games, NF’s work can also be seen, as he’s been hired by various channels and television shows to showcase his music. Some of the shows he’s worked on include “Empire”, “Grimm” and “Chicago PD”, and his music can also be heard on channels such as Showtime, VH1, and ESPN.</p><p>In 2016 he released his second album “Therapy Session”, and quickly followed it up in 2017 with his third studio album, “Perception”, which was highly successful, debuting at the&nbsp;top&nbsp;of the Billboard 200, making him the second artist to release an album without having it chart first on the Hot 100. The album was certified platinum, and he embarked on a tour alongside rappers Kyle and Logic. One of his latest releases is 2019’s “The Search”, an album that was released coupled with its titular single.</p><p>While NF’s music has been identified as Christian, he admitted that he isn’t a Christian rapper. He is a Christian, but his rap and beliefs don’t necessarily reflect the views of everyone. They don’t have to be a Christian to like or relate to them.</p><p>He mentions that one of his biggest influences is fellow rapper Eminem.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Bridgett began dating NF, he became a frequent feature on her various social media accounts. Recently he’s been featured less, as she’s put more focus back to her brand, only posting about them during special occasions. The couple married in 2018, after becoming engaged earlier in the year. The couple resides in Tennessee, and she remains very passionate about living a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle, focusing on exercising regularly, and health foods, promoting her lifestyle to those who are also interested.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyYmnq2utOoo51lpKfCtbSMqJ1mppaoeri1xZ5km6qZmbSmwNOeZJ2nopq6tr%2BMsKCkoV2WtKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
