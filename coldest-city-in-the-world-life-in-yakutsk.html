Visibility is poor due to “ice fog,” a thick mist that forms when it’s too cold for hot air to rise. This is winter in Yakutsk.</p><h2><span id=Yakutsk_Locals_Resilience_in_the_Face_of_Biting_Cold>Yakutsk Locals’ Resilience in the Face of Biting Cold</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/yakusts-2.jpg alt="coldest city in the world" width=840 height=560 sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The air in Yakutsk can make your skin go numb if exposed, possibly leading to frostbite. However, many locals don’t seem bothered by it. Anastasia Gruzdeva, a resident, says, “You can’t fight it. You either adjust and dress accordingly or you suffer. You don’t really feel the cold in the city. Or maybe it’s just the brain prepares you for it and tells you everything is normal.”</p><h2><span id=Residents_of_the_Coldest_City_in_the_World>Residents of the Coldest City in the World</span></h2><p>Yakutsk is home to more than 300,000 people and is one of Siberia’s fastest-growing regional cities, despite its extreme cold and remote location, 3,100 miles from Moscow.</p><p>Situated on the Lena River, it’s a mining city where wages can be higher due to the <a href=#>challenging climate</a>. It also attracts adventurous tourists curious about its frosty reputation.</p><p>Nurgusun Starostina, another resident, sells frozen fish at an outdoor market and doesn’t even need a freezer. “Just dress warmly,” she advises. “In layers, like a cabbage!”</p><h2><span id=Yakutsk_Ice_Age_Wonders>&nbsp;Yakutsk Ice Age Wonders</span></h2><p>Yakutsk is also known for its association with the Ice Age, particularly the woolly mammoth. The<a href=#> city houses</a> the Mammoth Museum, where visitors can view woolly mammoth fossils, and the Melnikov Permafrost Institute’s Underground Laboratory, which features fossils in below-freezing temperatures.</p><h2><span id=The_Coldest_City_in_the_World_Unique_Architecture>The Coldest City in the World Unique Architecture</span></h2><p>The city is built on continuous permafrost, meaning frozen soil is present even in the summer. Many buildings are constructed on stilts due to these conditions, which can threaten foundations when the frost thaws.</p><h2><span id=Residents_Adaptability>Residents Adaptability</span></h2><p>Life in this freezing city can be tough, especially when temperature records are broken. Yet, residents have found ways to adapt. This is doubly true for smaller villages like Oymyakon, a rural locality in the Sakha Republic.</p><p>Living in Oymyakon comes with unique challenges. “A guy I was staying with left his car running all night, but even so, in the morning, the drive shaft was completely frozen,” photographer Amos Chapple recalled to Smithsonian magazine’s Natasha Geiling in 2015.</p><p>“Without any ceremony, he pulled out a little flamethrower, went under the truck, and started fanning the bottom with it. It’s part of the toolkit for living in Oymyakon, a little flamethrower.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifKS7y52crKxdmLa1xYyipWasmJp6uLvRpZtmpJmbsm61zWawmqOlqcCsew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
