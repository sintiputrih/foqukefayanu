Despite the seat mixup, Kesha seemed to be in good spirits during the show, where she introduced rapper Logic’s moving performance of “1-800-273-8255,” a song that explores someone struggling with suicidal thoughts. The song’s title is the phone number for <a href=#>the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“It takes great courage to show the vulnerable side of being human and we all have that vulnerable side,” Kesha told the audience. “Whatever you are going through, however dark it may seem, there is an undeniable truth and strength in the fact that you are not alone. We all have struggles and as long as you never give up on yourself, light will break through the darkness.”</p><p>Her latest single, “Praying,” was i<a href=#>nspired by her own “severe hopelessness and depression</a>.” As previously reported, Kesha and her former music producer <b>Dr. Luke</b> had been involved in <a href=#>an ongoing legal battle</a>. In 2014, she alleged that he drugged her and claimed he was physically, sexually and mentally abusive. He has denied the allegations and maintains his innocence. She eventually dropped the case in California in August 2016 to focus on releasing new music, but the suit is still ongoing in New York.</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavpZGoenN8kHBksKCpYrimv8eaZKyZpGK8r3nToZxmnpykvLN51m1wcnFgbXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
