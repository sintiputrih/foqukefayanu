When asked by<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Vulture</a> how she kept her participation a secret from colleagues and family, she said: "This is why I’m so glad I’m Indian. I have such a huge family, so I’d say someone was getting married every weekend.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKITu00S95n data-wc=49>"Indian weddings last, like, a week, which is great, because if I needed to work on something baking-related during the week as well, I’d say it was wedding-related.
