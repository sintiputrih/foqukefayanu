He would eventually part ways with WWE and make a name for himself elsewhere; most notably in TNA, where he was known as Pope D’Angelo Dinero. That being said, it seems Burke refused to join The Spirit Squad during the early stages of his WWE career.</p><p>In 2006, The Spirit Squad debuted on Monday Night RAW. They would then go on to feud with D-Generation X and engaged in a lot of childish antics throughout the feud. Kenny and Mikey also defeated The Big Show and Kane to become the World Tag Team Champions.</p><p>However, The Spirit Squad ended up disbanding later that year. While speaking on <a href=#>the&nbsp;Cafe de Rene&nbsp;podcast</a>, Mikey confirmed that Elijah Burke rejected joining The Spirit Squad. Mikey believes that Burke made the right move by refusing to join the group.</p><p>“Yes. Yes, he did. And fortunately for him, he definitely made the right move because I think he had a really good and luscious career going forward after that. You know, he took a chance, he bet on himself, and I wanna say it worked out for him, you know.</p><p>He had a great run as The Pope, you know, TNA. He had a good run in WWE, the ECW brand. He was working like the main events with [CM] Punk. He was always in the mix and Elijah turned out to be a hell of a hand. A great worker. A great Talker. So, good for Elijah man.</p><p>The Spirit Squad would make a brief return back in 2016-17, as they were heavily involved in Dolph Ziggler’s feud with The Miz. We wonder whether Elijah Burke will ever return to WWE, as it seems very unlikely now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this Spirit Squad story?
