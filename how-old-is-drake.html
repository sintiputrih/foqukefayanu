Let’s shed some light on the international music superstar.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>One thing a lot of Drake’s fans have wondered over the years is how tall he is. They’ve even speculated that the star might wear lifts while out in public.
