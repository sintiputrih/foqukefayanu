He knows that he's got her feeling weak in the knees, and she can't get enough of him. He wants to give her everything that she wants and needs, and won't stop until she's completely satisfied. He's adoring her and taking care of her in every possible way, even keeping a Glock on his waist to protect her.</p><br><p>The artist is also trying to convey that he isn't like the other guys that his lover has been with in the past. He's a gangster, and he knows that he can provide for her and protect her in ways that others can't. He wants to be with her always, and he isn't afraid to show her his softer side. He knows all of the small things that make her happy, and he's willing to do anything to keep her smiling.</p><br><p>Overall, "Euphoria" is a song about the intense rush of emotions that come with being in love. It's about wanting to give everything to the person you adore and being willing to do anything to make them happy.</p><br><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line
