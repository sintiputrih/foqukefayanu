The duo went out for a workout on April 1 before Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued a statewide shelter in place to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>The 50-year-old showed off her toned abs as she and her 44-year-old fiancé were seen emerging from the backdoor of the gym. Although the Miami gym was closed to the public amid COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed the couple was still allowed to go there for a workout.</p><p>“THIS GYM IS NOT OPEN STAY HOME STAY SAFE,” a sign at the backdoor of the gym read. According to reports, J-Rod are frequent visitors to the venue.</p><p>The ‘Maid in Manhattan’ star was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spotted</a> in a scarlet sports bra that showed off her toned dancer's figure including her trim midriff. She paired the sexy top with an elaborately patterned pair of high-waisted leggings and accessorized with huge aviator sunglasses.</p><p>The mother-of-two also winded her hair up into a bun while carrying her usual sparkly monogrammed water bottle. On the other hand, her partner Rodriguez, who Lopez is engaged to marry, wore a simple black cardigan and sweats over a charcoal tee.</p><p>Reports also revealed that a gentleman in a face mask was also spotted with the couple as he held the gym's backdoor handle through a wet wipe to swing it open when the pair was done exercising. He was also seen cleaning the handle of one of the car doors with a wipe before opening it to allow Jennifer into the gleaming black vehicle.</p><p>Like many people across the world, including celebrities and famous personalities, Lopez and the former professional baseball shortstop have also gone into quarantine together in Miami with children from their past relationships. A-Rod is a father of two daughters, Natasha, 15, and Ella, 11, whom he shares with his ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis while J-Lo is a mother of twins, Max and Emme, aged 12, by her third husband Marc Anthony.</p><p>This was not the first time Lopez has shown off her chiseled body. Recently when the 'Waiting For Tonight' singer was on a birthday vacation, she showed off her sculpted body on&nbsp; <a href=# rel>social media</a>. Dressed in a black and white string bikini, she gave us major body goals while captioning her post: "Island vibezzz... #vacaciones."</p><p>The picture came a few days after she posted an album of her birthday pictures. Her fans noticed giant bling on her ring finger, which was reportedly gifted by her beau. Rodriguez had gifted the diamond, onyx, emerald and white gold ring to Lopez back in February 2020 when the duo was caught browsing the Cartier store in Miami together. The current engagement ring is Lopez’s fifth one as the others were from her three husbands and ex-fiance Ben Affleck.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopWju6qyxKtkpaegmsduwM6nnJ1lkZfAbq3Lnq9mqp%2BZv6qz1J6xZq6ZpXqir8KeqqxlnZ6urrWMoLCm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
