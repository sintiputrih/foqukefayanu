Wood’s success did not end with Return of the King, either."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the years since the final Lord of the Rings film was released, he’s appeared in a number of popular television series and movies. He shifted up his style in the following years, starring in Sin City and Maniac for the big screen and blowing audiences away with his weird but delightful take on characters like Ryan Newman in Wilfred and Todd Brotzman in Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>On top of everything else, Wood has found consistent work in voice acting. He’s lended his talent to several high-profile releases, like Tim Burton’s 9, and even appeared in a range of video games.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Elijah Wood’s net worth</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1323108867.jpg><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Wood’s robust career has hardly slowed down since his days on the Lord of the Rings set. He’s lent his talent to a huge number of projects across the entertainment industry, from film and television to video games, music videos, and audio books. Hardly a year has passed since 1990 without a fresh Wood release, even if some of them managed to pass under the radar.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true>Wood’s work ethic and wise financial decisions have yielded him a net worth of around $20 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Wood didn’t make the massive income many might expect from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, according to the site, instead raking in paychecks in the low to mid hundreds of thousands. Considering the films’ massive cultural impact, the low monetary return for Wood is definitely a surprise.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Thankfully, Wood’s other work has aided in his ability to slowly build up a solid financial cushion. He finds frequent work across the entertainment industry, allowing him to live comfortably in his $1 million Austin, Texas home.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnEpaCjmZhixLC7w6xkp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
