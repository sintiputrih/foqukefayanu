Pretty much everyone loves sharing their own lists with their friends and family.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One of the coolest features that Spotify Wrapped affords users is being able to see where they rank compared to other listeners of the same artist, manifesting in a top percent figure shown in Wrapped to the chosen few who are truly devoted to that person's music. So, what does that top percent figure actually mean?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What exactly does top percent mean on Spotify Wrapped?</h2><p>The title "top percent" reflects that a user is in an artist's top listening base, essentially meaning they listen to their music more than the average listener.</p><p>The way that Spotify calculates if you're in an artist's top percent hasn't ever really been fully disclosed, but it's safe to assume that the app takes into account a variety of factors when judging, including both total time spent listening and the number of songs played.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The data is collected from Jan.1 to "a few weeks before launch," per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify FAQ page</a>. Spotify then calculates and prepares the yearly wrapped for a late November or early December delivery.</p><p>If you're eager to get into an artist's top percent next year, the best bet is to start listening as much as you can right on New Year's Day.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do you figure out if you're in an artist's top percent?</h2><p>Thankfully, Spotify makes it fairly easy to find out if you're in an artist's top percentage via Spotify Wrapped. Simply launch the Spotify app and click on the "2023 Wrapped" icon, or alternatively, the pop-up window of the same link if given one automatically.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Once you've entered the Wrapped sequence, click the "Explore Your Wrapped" prompt, which will take you through all of your top artists for the year.
