There is still very little information available, but ABC 33/44 reported that family were seen crying and hugging each other in relief. A new update should be available very shortly. After the father of the child, Harlow Darby Freeman, reported that his SUV had been stolen in Parrish, Alabama, on Monday evening just before 7 o’clock local time, authorities first suspected that the child, who has been identified as Harlow Darby Freeman, had been abducted.</p><p>According to a report on AL.com, the father had briefly stopped by the home of a friend, and when he returned one minute later, the vehicle had disappeared. The ALEA issued an Amber Alert for Harlow almost three hours later after it had previously been missing. Instead, it is thought that the father did not put the vehicle entirely in park, which caused it to roll backwards into a dense area of kudzu that was located across the street. According to the publication, Parrish police Chief Danny Woodard stated that “Daylight was our friend on this one.” “Daylight was our friend on this one.”</p><p>The Amber Alert for the missing infant of Bethany Smith, who was located safe in Alabama, has been cancelled. An infant who was nine months old at the time of an alleged kidnapping that took place on Monday evening is presumed to be missing at this time. This is a tragic turn of events that has caused a great deal of emotional distress. Bethany Smith, the concerned mother, resorted to social media to describe the terrifying experience she had been going through and to appeal to the general public for assistance in locating her missing child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwrsStn5qmqWLArrXToWSmoaOotq%2BzjJqkm52iYq6tsdGtZJyZnpiyrbHDZpifrJWneqq6xZqlrWWWpMKvsIysmJ%2BdXZ67bq3LmpmapZFk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
