“I was supposed to be here at 4,” he explained."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He also revealed that fiancée <b>Olivia Wilde </b>had a <b>Beyoncé</b>-related false alarm just days before welcoming their bundle of joy.</p><p>The 41-year-old actor was supposed to stop by <b>Harry Connick Jr.</b>’s new talk show last Tuesday, but ended up canceling because Wilde gave birth that day.</p><p>“I was supposed to be here at 4,” he explained. “She came out at 3:39. She does not care about show business, but she will!”</p><p>Sudeikis then went on to explain that he thought Daisy might make her debut earlier than expected. He and Queen Bey enthusiast Wilde were on their way to see the “Formation” singer, 35, in concert on Friday, October 7, but had to turn around because the <i>Lazarus Effect</i> actress, 32, started having contractions.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"></p><p>“We came really close,” Sudeikis told Connick Jr., 49. “Daisy was born on Tuesday, but on Friday night, [Olivia] and I were going out — date night. This is how confident of a lady Olivia is: She’s like, ‘Date night, we’re going to go see Beyoncé.’ So, we were in line to get in the Lincoln Tunnel and there was an accident in there,” he recalled. “Everything was gummed up, so it was going to take us like an hour to get through the tunnel, and we would have been a half hour late to the concert, which would have been a bummer because we would miss all the choreography and fireworks.”</p><p>Sudeikis added: “I don’t know if it was the pressure, if it was the traffic, or the fact that we were going to be late. It was just bad in the back seat of the car. We U-turned and got it out of there. We figured it would be a bad scene to have the baby in a tunnel — and a little redundant!”</p><p>The <i>Horrible Bosses</i> star — who once threw a Beyoncé-themed birthday party for his and Wilde’s 2-year-old son, Otis — joked with Connick Jr. that he believes Daisy was slaying some of the superstar’s choreography in the womb when Wilde thought she was about to give birth.</p><p>“We hightailed it to [the] Upper East Side [in New York City] where the hospital was, got out of the car, walked around [the] neighborhood a little bit. Then, Daisy calmed down. I think she was just fired up,” he said. “Just sitting there doing the [‘Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)’] dance, like, ‘I know where I’m going!'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple announced the birth of Daisy via Instagram on October 15. “There goes the neighborhood. Daisy Josephine Sudeikis,” Wilde captioned a sweet snap of her little one sleeping. “Born, like a boss, on #internationaldayofthegirl. ❤️”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajmaOku26%2F1J2coqOZqHqowdKhnKxln6uys3nNnq6bp6KjeqWt1KCfrZ2iYrGitdKyZLBsZGt9eHyO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
