The mark of any truly impactful cultural footprint: You either hate them or you love them, there’s no in-between.</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>To this day, Swifties regularly quote the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iconic tweet</a> from 2019, “Since y’all wanna be assholes for Taylor. Iron man dies in endgame [SIC].” And who could forget that time Taylor borrowed Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool costume for Halloween (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a premonition if we’ve ever seen one</a>)? The MCU and the “Cruel Summer” singer have always been destined to meet, we’re just speeding up the process.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false>Here are 27 Marvel characters matched to sheer perfection to their Taylor Swift song.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Thanos: “Lavender Haze”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Thanos.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>Sure, “Look What You Made Me Do” or “Vigilante S**t” would suffice for Thanos, but we’d be remiss not to give this purple Mad Titan a song befitting of his skin-tone. Now, I’d like you to promptly imagine this genocidal maniac seductively dipping his cheekbone in a pool of purple, lavender-filled water. You’re welcome!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Loki: “Anti-Hero”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Loki.jpg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>What a journey Loki has had in the MCU. “Anti-Hero” might not be among the songs Taylor has written about her whirlwind romance with Tom Hiddleston, but it certainly best <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">describes his Marvel character</a>. Every villain either dies as one (and, believe us, he tried) or lives long enough to see himself become an anti-hero.</p><h2 id=h-thor-love-story data-injectable=false>Thor: “Love Story”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Thor-Love-and-Thunder.jpg><p data-characters=627 data-current-count=927 data-injectable=true>He was Romeo, she was Juliet — but they drew too many stars around each other’s scars, and eventually those scars started bleeding (sorry, mixing up songs here). Anyway, fast forward eight years, seven months, and six days, and come to find out this pair’s love story wasn’t finished being written yet. Then Marvel had to go and ruin it all. That’s where Taylor’s “Love Story” comes into play. Let’s just forget Marvel’s tragic ending, and imagine that Thor and Jane continued to teach each other the “way of the warrior” and the “way of the people.” And they lived happily ever after.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Star-Lord & Gamora: “I Knew You Were Trouble”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Star-Lord-and-Gamora.jpg><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Some romances are easy-peasy, and some go together like oil and water. Given that Gamora only said one sentence to Peter in Guardians of the Galaxy before kicking him in the stomach, stealing the Orb, and then stealing his heart, there’s perhaps no better pairing for “I Knew You Were Trouble” than these two.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Steve & Bucky: “Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Steve-and-Bucky.jpg><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Sorry, the opportunity to match this iconic song to Steve and Bucky was right there, and we couldn’t not take it. You know how it goes, Mister Americana and his Heartbreak Prince are with each other until the end of the line.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Steve & Tony from Captain America: Civil War: “Bad Blood”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Civil-War.jpg><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>Taylor initially wrote this 2010s pop staple about Katy Perry, but that’s only a tiny jump away from the feud that put the two Avengers leaders on a path of collision that eventually led to an actual Civil War. Taylor might have compared Katy stealing some of her tour dancers to a “bullet hole,” but not even she could match the dramatics of Tony and Steve in Captain America 3.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Starfox: “Style”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Starfox.jpg><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>I mean… did you expect anything else? Taylor never reveals who her songs are about, but “Style” was always a no-brainer. This pairing is a match made in heaven, even if the romance that inspired it was short-lived. We may never see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfox in the MCU again</a>, but Harry Styles is the perfect Eros. There, I said it. Sue me.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Matt Murdock: “Vigilante S**t”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Daredevil.jpg><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>Sometimes in order to get things done, you’ve got to do some vigilante s**t, am I right? No one knows that better than Taylor — ahem, I mean Matt Murdock. This Devil of Hell’s Kitchen is a man of law in the courtroom, but he’s not above bypassing those guardrails on the streets if it means catching the bad guy. Taylor also knows a thing or two about catching the bad guy — or, at least, that’s the assumption if our theories about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">genesis of “Vigilante S**t”</a> are correct.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Scarlet Witch: “Mad Woman”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Scarlet-Witch.jpg><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>As two deeply empathetic women who have had to face constant scrutiny from a young age, there was an abundance of Taylor Swift songs that perfectly matched Wanda Maximoff (the entire Reputation album, for starters). Yet, there’s none that quite matches the desperation of a woman pushed to her limit like “Mad Woman” from the masterpiece that is folklore.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers: “The Man”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Captain-Marvel.jpg><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=840 data-injectable=true>Carol Danvers has been at the receiving end of a lot of unjustified flak during her time in the MCU. The way a particularly toxic subsection of the Marvel fandom turned against both the character, and actor Brie Larson, and mobilized to boycott her movies was unprecedented. People hated Carol for being cold, angry, and stand-offish, which, go figure, have historically been traits those same viewers find cool in male characters. And Taylor Swift knows all about being chastised for things that are usually celebrated in the opposite sex.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Clint Barton/Hawkeye: “The Archer”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Hawkeye.jpg><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>I’ll confess, I initially paired Clint with “The Archer” because, well, that’s what he is! However, upon revisiting this introspective ballad, I realized just how fitting its lyrics are for a man who has been defined by the death of his loved ones — namely, the heartbreaking end of his best friend and hero, Natasha.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow: “Bigger Than The Whole Sky”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Natasha.jpg><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>There have been a lot of heartbreaking deaths in the MCU, but none have felt as unjust as Natasha’s. Although her sacrifice was equivalent to that of Tony’s, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t even get the honor of a funeral</a>. We’ll never forgive Marvel for that.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Quentin Beck/Mysterio: “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Mysterio.jpg><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>We all know this choice wasn’t completely innocent. It is rumored this iconic bop was written about Jake Gyllenhaal, but it’s also quite fitting for his character Quentin Beck, since Taylor is describing the most obnoxious man alive in the lyrics. Jake is a fantastic actor, and he completely nailed his performance as Mysterio, but good God, I think he’s the villain I have wanted to strangle the most out of anyone in the MCU.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dr. Strange: “Hey Stephen”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Doctor-Strange.jpg><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>Underneath his rich playboy exterior, Stephen Strange is a sweetheart. He can never say no to a teenager in need, and he can be quite funny when he wants. Taylor said it best: Hey, Stephen, “Come feel this magic I’ve been feeling since I met you.” It’s not often an Avenger has a Taylor Swift song named after them, after all.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nebula: “Tolerate It”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Nebula.jpg><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>We know Taylor is probably singing about a dismissive lover in this heartwrenching ballad, but there are a lot of lyrics that scream “daddy issues” here, too. There are, in fact, a lot of characters with absent fathers in the MCU. Loki or Tony Stark would be great fits here too, but there’s something about the way Nebula tried to do her best for her dad at all times, and received nothing but contempt and violence in return, that has always made us root harder for her character. Thankfully, in the end, just like Taylor in “Tolerate It,” she realized she deserved better.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Peter Parker & MJ: “It’s Nice to Have a Friend”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Peter-and-MJ.jpg><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=812 data-injectable=true>Out of all iterations of Spider-Man on the big screen, Tom Holland and the MCU’s feels the most like a true, awkward teenager trying to navigate the confusing world of puberty and superheroism. A lot of that is down to Peter’s relationship with M.J., which is simultaneously wholesome and mature for its level of commitment and partnership. We love the idea of these two lovebirds going from childhood friends to an old married couple, just like Taylor describes in this beautifully innocent lullaby.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Valkyrie: “King of My Heart”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Captain-Marvel-Valkyrie.jpg><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>We believe this one is pretty self-explanatory. Obviously, Taylor is singing to a man here, but we are huge fans of the way the MCU took a page from Beyoncé’s book and made this iconic lady the new King of Asgard. Given the extreme queer energy that King Brunnhilde exudes, we are definitely happy to turn this love song into a women-loving-women anthem for the purposes of this list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Adam Warlock: “Bejeweled”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Adam-Warlock.jpg><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>The MCU version of Adam Warlock may have been more of a derp than a threat, but hey, that gold skin was blinding all the same. No, that isn’t the Mind Stone on his forehead, or the Soul Stone — both of those were destroyed in Avengers: Endgame. It’s probably just his birthstone. We’re thinking topaz. Just imagine how bright he makes the whole place shimmer when he stands under the mirrorball.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He Who Remains: “Mastermind”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-He-Who-Remains.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>Mr. Free-will-stealer himself is the perfect pair for this infectious Taylor banger about how she carefully planned the meeting and courtship of her lover, all the while trying to trick him into thinking it was all fate. That’s basically what He Who Remains was doing to everyone on the Sacred Timeline for eons, right?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Hela: “Better Than Revenge”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Hela.jpg><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>The ultimate baddie T-Swift song for the ultimate Marvel baddie. The lyrics of “Better Than Revenge” (even the revised ones) are practically tailor-made for Hela, who returns from imprisonment in Thor: Ragnarok to reclaim the crown her younger brother Thor stole from her. Now, we don’t condone revenge, but if you’re the Goddess of Death, we won’t deny it’s fun to watch. Wait, does that mean Taylor’s… ? Never mind.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Deadpool/Wade Wilson: “Karma”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Deadpool.jpg><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Honestly, we’ll let this image speak for itself. But also, we really need Taylor to give her bestie Ryan the rights to this song in Deadpool 3, and create what would easily be the most iconic needle drop in the history of the MCU (sorry, James Gunn and Peter’s Awesome Mix!).</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Avengers: Endgame: “End Game”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-Endgame.jpg><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>We did it. We made it to the endgame. Taylor might as well have been signing directly to the Avengers and Thanos with this contemporary lyrical hit. Avengers: Endgame saw the “A-team” reach back in time to restore the universe to its rightful state and confront Thanos, whose reputation preceded him, in the ultimate showdown that blew the Marvel universe — and the box office — wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>King T’Challa/Black Panther: “Long Live”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-MCU-TChalla.jpg><p data-characters=674 data-current-count=974 data-injectable=false>Sorry, we didn’t mean to sucker punch you in the gut, but we couldn’t pass up this opportunity to honor T’Challa and Chadwick Boseman’s legacy. “Long Live” not only encapsulates the significance of T’Challa and Boseman’s impact on Marvel, but also their impact on cinema and the Marvel fandom. “Long live the walls we crashed through,” Taylor sings, and indeed,&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;blew through expectations to become the highest-grossing movie directed by a Black filmmaker, with Boseman as its leading man. “One day, we will be remembered,” sings Taylor —&nbsp; This one’s for you, Chadwick. From all of us. You will never be forgotten.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoaXBlnZa%2Ft7HLZpqhmaKWsLWx0axkmqaUYsGpscirZKaZpJi1qrrGZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWjpLuoew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
