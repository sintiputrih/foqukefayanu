Young Thug has been announced as the musical guest on this weekend’s episode, and is likely to perform the hit-song Ski with Travis.</p><p>Kourtney also attended the rehearsals, and shared photos of her backstage pass on her Instagram stories. Her sister Kim made her SNL debut only last week!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For their day out, Kourtney wore a snake-print coat dress with platform knee-high boots and dark sunglasses, while Travis opted for a casual, all-black attire. Her outfit earned negative reactions from social media users, who were unhappy about her "morphing" into her boyfriend.</p><p>"The outfit should change depending of the person I’m dating with? Damn I’ve been doing all wrong these whole time..." a fan trolled Kourtney in the comments.</p><p>"Why she switched up her look completely? She morphed into rock/goth!" added another.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker Get Trolled For Their NSFW Behavior At Disneyland</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ll never get people like this whose style and personality always changes to match their romantic partner.

Does she really not know that she doesn’t have to dress like him?" wrote a user.</p><p>"Why do women morph into their men?" inquired another.</p><p>The Poosh founder's fashion choices have been clearly influenced by her partner, who has quickly become important in her life and something of a father-figure to her children. Travis also helped teach Kourtney's daughter Penelope (who she shares with ex Scott Disick) play her drum set, which she received as a present on her ninth birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As per sources close to the couple, Kourtney and Travis quickly developed a serious connection.
