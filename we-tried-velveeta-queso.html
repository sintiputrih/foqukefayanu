For others, however, there's nothing quite like the smooth and creamy Velveeta Cheese they know and love."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's up there with canned spray cheese, and to some people, that just doesn't cut it. For others, however, there's nothing quite like the smooth and creamy Velveeta Cheese they know and love. And that's exactly who needs to try <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Velveeta Queso</a>, which comes in three different varieties. All of which, by the way, <a href=#>we tried</a> to test each of them out.</p><p>The cheese already came in multiple different kinds of slices and blocks for easy melting. However, now, it's here in jarred queso that you can either eat out of the container or warm up with your favorite tortilla chips. Velveeta is also rolling out two brand new Shells & Cheese flavors, but we can get to that later.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Distractify</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">We tried Velveeta Queso.</h2><p>The Velveeta Queso comes in three flavors — Velveeta Queso Blanco, Velveeta Queso Con Salsa, and Velveeta Jalapeño. We aren't here to rate them from best to worst, exactly, but after trying all three, we do have an idea about how they each taste. And, of course, we have an idea about which one of the Velveeta Queso dips just so happens to taste the best.</p><p>First up we have the Velveeta Queso Con Salsa. It's not unlike typical salsa con queso you might find in a jar from other brands. However, it is pretty thick, and the way to solve that issue is to heat it up before dunking your favorite salty snack into it. Overall, it's a definite step above some other salsa con queso dips thanks to its natural creaminess.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by VELVEETA (@velveeta)</a></p></figure><p>The next dip is the Velveeta Jalapeño. It has the most kick to it, which probably isn't a total surprise. But even if you prefer heat with your queso, the jalapeño might be almost too overpowering here.</p><p>The third one is Velveeta Queso Blanco. It doesn't have the iconic orange color that we all know Velveeta for, but that doesn't mean it's not a quality option for those of us who have an affinity for queso blanco. The flavor definitely takes you away from standard Velveeta Cheese, which is why it works as a queso blanco. And if we were rating the Velveeta Queso dips, this one just might top the list.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Distractify</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Velveeta also rolled out new Shells & Cheese flavors.</h2><p>In addition to the three Velveeta Queso options, the brand rolled out two new Shells & Cheese flavors for customers. These are Buffalo and Pizza. The flavor is added to the typical Shells & Cheese you might already be familiar with, but you can add in your own additional flavors to really make it your own.</p><p>And as yet another addition to the Shells & Cheese sub-brand, Velveeta is releasing Gluten-Free Shells & Cheese.</p><p>You can follow @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Velveeta</a> on Instagram to keep up with the news and keep track of where and how to find Velveeta Queso yourself, starting in May 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLJuwNGinJ1lppq5t7HErZhmqaWawLA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
