I think it’s a totally justified quest, and we’ll continue to see this dichotomy between somebody who is still holding a fraternal connection to Stephen Strange, and somebody who does think about the bigger picture.”</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Mordo’s return in Multiverse of Madness doesn’t have him pegged down as a clear villain or hero – but the plot synopsis does tease a “former friend” who gets entangled with Strange.
