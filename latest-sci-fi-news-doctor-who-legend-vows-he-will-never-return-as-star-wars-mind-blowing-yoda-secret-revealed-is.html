When faced with the inevitable question of whether he’ll pull a Tennant and hop in the TARDIS again, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Capaldi has surprisingly vowed</a> that we won’t be seeing him in any future multi-Doctor crossovers as he has no interest in “digging” up his old role as the Twelfth Doctor. Well, now we know.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Star Wars proves Yoda has been trolling the entire galaxy all along</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Star-Wars-Return-Of-The-Jedi-Yoda-1.jpeg><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>Despite Grogu owning all our hearts, we still don’t know all that much about Yoda’s species, so it came as quite the shock when Yaddle appeared in Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi — as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard</a>, no less — and it turns out she talks like everybody else. This tells us that Yoda’s kind don’t actually have to speak backward, after all, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> is having a field day over this hilarious fact, as it means that Yoda has just been trolling everyone for the past 900 years.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wait, who was that Inquisitor in Tales of the Jedi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-sixth-brother-star-wars-tales-of-the-jedi.png><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=846 data-injectable=true>Staying with Tales of the Jedi for a moment, the animated miniseries’ finale offers a glimpse at what Ahsoka did in the wake of Order 66, featuring her battling an Inquisitor on her trail. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">But which Inquisitor is it?</a> Fans initially assumed it was the Sixth Brother, introduced in 2016’s Ahsoka novel, due to a certain resemblance between the two characters, but this would wipe that story from canon. It’s vaguely possible they are one and the same, but it’s more likely this is an Inquisitor we’ve never met before.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Cloud Atlas a gift from above or a map to misery? Nobody can decide</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cloud-atlas.jpg><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=869 data-injectable=true>The term “divisive” is often applied to films when really all that’s meant is that a few people don’t like it but most love it. However, the term is entirely accurate when it comes to the Wachowskis’ Cloud Atlas, the eons-spanning sci-fi epic that’s now a full decade old, and yet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the movie-loving community still cannot agree</a> on whether it’s an underrated masterpiece of unconventional cinema or if it’s just a turgid, poorly executed mess. Let’s give it another 10 years and see if everyone can agree on it then.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>Steer your spaceships back in this direction tomorrow, sci-fi nation, for another daily roundup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytrdOeqq1lo5i2brLIZqWer6NisbCv06ipZq%2BYpHqtscaepZ1lpqTEtHnHnmSwoZyheq%2Bx1Z6pZqqVqcKzuoyaqmarpJa%2FbsPAq6pmpZmjsW6uy6iuoqaXYsawsMBmqp6boprBbr7Er5yapJWZeqq%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
