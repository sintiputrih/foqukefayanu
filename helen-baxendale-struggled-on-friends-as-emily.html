We were never great mates though. People expect because it is called 'Friends' that everyone was great friends, but they were real professionals. They'd been doing it for years and I was one of many guest stars to appear," the actress stated alongside Mirror.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>A 27-Second Ovation From The Studio Audience On Friends Changed Everything For Chandler And Monica's Romance Storyline</a></span></p><p>Looking back, Helen is proud of her time on the show, though she feels as though it isn't a part of her life, nor career.

Yes, the fame was a lot to handle but Helen admits this decision wasn't done by choice, as roles in the US just weren't available after the show.</p><p>"I don't have any regrets whatsoever because it has been my life. I've been very privileged, I'm lucky and I'm still alive.</p><p>I've pursued every avenue open to me ever, so I don't really understand the idea that I walked away from opportunities. No other jobs came up!
