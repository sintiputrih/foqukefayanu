As usual, comedic hijinks led to a variety of misunderstandings, which created an awkward situation when Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) met Joshua's parents for the first time in a minimum of clothing. Somewhat surprisingly, the two Perrys did not actually share any scenes.</p><p>However, the father-son duo appeared in a variety of other productions together. They first shared the small screen in a 1979 episode of "240-Robert," a series about a special task force within the Los&nbsp;Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The elder Perry led the series as&nbsp;Deputy Theodore Roosevelt "Trap" Applegate III. The younger Perry made his television debut at age 9 as a character named Arthur. In the episode, titled "Bank Job," Trapp's team is forced to combat a team of bank robbers, during which Trapp meets a number of young civilians, including Arthur, who are caught in the mix. They next joined forces in 1993 on the third episode of "Home Free," a short-lived sitcom centered on Matt Bailey, a character portrayed by a 23-year-old Matthew. In the episode, Bailey, a young and overly self-confident journalist, confronts a judge (John Bennett Perry), who he believes is corrupt. In 1997, they also both appeared in "Fools Rush In,"&nbsp;a romantic comedy starring Matthew and Salma Hayek.&nbsp;</p><p>Seven years later, the two were back on the small screen again, appearing in a single episode of "Scrubs" together. Their final shared TV appearance came courtesy of the final episode of Matthew's short-lived 2011 sitcom, "Mr. Sunshine."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjZ4Z2fY6wn5qsXayybrfNqK5mpZGpwamx1mannqqirnqnrcyorKxllpbBqbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
