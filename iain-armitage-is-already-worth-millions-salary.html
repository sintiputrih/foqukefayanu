Having beaten off stiff competition, he finally secured the opportunity of a lifetime, and has been shining in it ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s The Big Bang Theory Cast's Brutally Honest Thoughts About Young Sheldon</a></span></p><p>It helps that Armitage has <a href=#>constant guidance from Jim Parsons</a>, who played an older version of his character in Big Bang. It is also to his advantage that even at his young age, he is already a millionaire.</p><h2 id=iain-armitage-rsquo-s-young-sheldon-is-a-firm-fan-favorite-sitcom>Iain Armitage’s Young Sheldon Is A Firm Fan Favorite Sitcom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Young-Sheldon.jpg><p>Young Sheldon is a prequel series to the popular sitcom The Big Bang Theory, and follows the life of the young, titular Sheldon Cooper as he navigates his way through childhood and adolescence. Much like the older Sheldon portrayed by Jim Parsons, young Sheldon is highly intelligent but socially awkward, and struggles to fit in with his peers while also often finding himself at odds with his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Armitage — and the rest of his co-stars on the show — have done such a good job extending the Big Bang Theory universe, that there are those who feel that the spin-off series is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">better than the original</a>. One particular fan on Reddit even went as far as comparing Young Sheldon to another classic sitcom.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jim Parsons Got Emotional Watching Ian Armitage On Young Sheldon, But Parsons Originally Came Close to Turning Down The Reboot</a></span></p><p>“Young Sheldon has the same quirky style humor / vibe akin to Malcolm in the Middle,” the comment read. “The actors all do a phenomenal job, especially Iain Armitage. It's got heart, some really genuinely funny moments and most importantly...no laugh track!”</p><h2 id=how-much-is-iain-armitage-paid-per-young-sheldon-episode>How Much Is Iain Armitage Paid Per Young Sheldon Episode?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Iain-Armitage.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Working in Hollywood is so lucrative, that even a child actor can make a fortune from a major gig. That is certainly the case for Iain Armitage, who began his tenure on Young Sheldon in 2017 with a salary of $30,000 per episode.</p><p>That would mean that over the course of a 22-episode season, he earned a handsome $660,000. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a> , that episodic amount was reportedly raised to $31,200 for Season 2 and later $32,500 for Season 3.</p><p>Young Sheldon was renewed for a seventh season in March 2021. Season 6 premiered on CBS in September 2022, which suggests that the consequent installment should kick off in late 2023. While the report on Celebrity Net Worth does not specify how much the young Georgian is currently earning, it would stand to reason that he has likely surpassed the $32,500 he was reportedly on at least three years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite Its Massive Success, The Big Bang Theory's Producer Refused All Spin-Offs Except Young Sheldon</a></span></p><p>Young Sheldon remains the biggest job that Armitage has taken on in his short acting career, and would definitely be responsible for most of his current net worth.</p><h2 id=what-is-iain-armitage-rsquo-s-net-worth-in-2023>What Is Iain Armitage’s Net Worth In 2023?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/iain-armitage-young-sheldon.jpg><p>The very same Celebrity Net Worth piece estimates that Iain Armitage is worth around $6 million in 2023.</p><p>The actor has featured in multiple other TV shows and movies, but no other role comes close to the 118 episodes he has starred in for Young Sheldon. This would of course translate to the show being his main source of income so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Armitage’s salary on Young Sheldon may seem quite impressive, it is actually on the lower end of the spectrum for child actors in Hollywood. For example, Millie Bobby Brown, who stars in the hit Netflix series Stranger Things, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly earns $300,000 per episode</a>. Finn Wolfhard, who also stars in the same show is said to be on $250,000 for each episode.</p><p>In fairness, Armitage is significantly younger than Brown and Wolfhard and in that sense, arguably has more time on his side. Other than Young Sheldon, he is also known for playing Ziggy Chapman in the HBO drama series Big Little Lies. Other roles that he has taken on include in Impractical Jokers, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, as well as the movies I’m Not Here, Scoob! and PAW Patrol: The Movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigmqGeYq6zucitmKCdXZ7Abq3Lq5yanKlixLC%2B06FkpqGcobawutJmqpqkkafGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
