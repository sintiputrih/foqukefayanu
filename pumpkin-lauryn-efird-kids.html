In other words, Lauryn has four beautiful kids with her husband, <a href=#>Joshua Efird</a>.</p><p>Her firstborn child, Ella, was born in 2017. Ella's little brother Bentley followed in 2021. As Distractify previously reported, Lauryn also welcomed twins, a boy named Sylus Ray and a girl named Stella Renae, in early 2022.</p><p>So do Lauryn and Joshua have plans to keep expanding their family anytime soon? Lauryn <a href=#>told Distractify in 2022</a> in an exclusive interview, "Oh, no no ...

Lauryn then got full custody in 2022. Mama June's substance abuse struggles led to her and Pumpkin being estranged for a while.</p><p>But Lauryn and the rest of her sisters were present for Mama June's February 2023 wedding ceremony to Justin Stroud, indicating an improvement in the family situation.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lauryn EfirdðŸŒº (@pumpkin)</a></p></figure><p>Mama June even seemed to come to terms with Lauryn having custody of Alana. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TooFab</a> in May 2023: "Some hurtful things were said but also I didn't want to do any mud-slinging in the court room because I didn't want Alana to hate myself or Pumpkin."</p><p>She added: "I really didn't want to go through a nasty-a-- court battle because there could have been a lot of mud-slinging go on in that court case." She later noted that "you gotta pick and choose sometimes in life, even when you don't want to."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Family drama aside, Lauryn is dedicated to her kids (and her sister).</h2><p>Lauryn is a dedicated mama bear to her four children and Alana. She posts cute photos of her family constantly on her Instagram page (with the handle aptly being @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pumpkin</a>), even writing in a post for Ella that, "To be able to call you my daughter, I'm blessed beyond measure."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpcKuvMqipWakkaq%2FurqMnp2iqpRiuKqw0g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
