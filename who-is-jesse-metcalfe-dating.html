At the time, an insider told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, “They are definitely not back together. They own a home together. … Jesse lives in the guest house." Adding, "They had to make the mature decision to deal with this situation together like many people going through a breakup right now.”&nbsp;</p><p>The following month, the actress/blogger opened up about her mental health and reflected on her happiness. “Given that the total landscape of our world has changed, it’s been a really interesting time to reflect and reconnect,” she told Retreat magazine back in May.&nbsp;</p><p>She continued,&nbsp;“I feel at times that we’ve lost our moral compass. We’ve disconnected from our values, we’re destroying the plant, and literally, this pandemic has caused everyone to stop. I feel like we can either come out of this the same or we can come out of it differently, in a good way. This is a time for everyone to self-reflect.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKOdo6iybrnErZqapJaaeqWt06KloA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
