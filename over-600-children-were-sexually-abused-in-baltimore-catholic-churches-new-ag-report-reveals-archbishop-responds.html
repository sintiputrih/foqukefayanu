Recommended Videos Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown has concluded a four-year investigation of alleged sexual abuse that was so rampant that the entirety of the resulting 463-page Attorney General’s Report on Child Sexual Abuse in the Archdiocese of Baltimore is largely unbearable to read, due to the sheer volume of offenses against children in a period of secrecy that went on for several decades."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Victims were as young as six years old.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>The report exposes offenders including Father Louis John Affrica, who would take young teenage boys on retreats and sexually abuse them after getting them to drink and take drugs. The sexual abuses involved everything from fondling to rape. Affrica went on to become a social worker.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>The report also includes sex offenders who actually were punished — an unfortunate rarity — including Father John Banko, who twice raped his 11-year old altar boy, warning him to not tell anyone, otherwise he would harm the boy’s parents. Banko was eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison, after which other victims came forward with their testimonies of sexual abuse by the priest who, as a result, was then sentenced to an additional 26 years in prison.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>There are numerous examples of victims who felt that if they reported the abuse, that they would not be believed. In some instances, victims their families did report the offenses, though in the vast majority of those cases, disciplinary action by church leadership amounted to little more than a slap on a wrist for the abuser.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>The crimes are not limited to Baltimore; many of the abusers spending portions of their careers in parishes elsewhere, spreading their evil to about 20 different states.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Father John Davies, the report claims, “was in charge of the altar boys and gave out written punishment for misbehavior. When the boy didn’t complete his assignment in time, Davies took him to another part of the rectory and raped him anally.” The report goes on to explain that this happened multiple times a month, and that when the boy was in high school, he attempted suicide.</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>Davies also spent over thirty years as a chaplain of the Boy Scouts.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false>Father Robert Duerr raped a seven-year old girl, the report states.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>Father Frederick Duke of Shrine of the Little Flower in Baltimore admitted to sexually abusing 26 children, which he got away with because his superiors — such as Archbishop Keough&nbsp; — knew of the abuses, and would send Duke away for “spiritual direction,” which never resulted in an end to the abuse.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>One unnamed victim stated, “Nothing has really changed with our ‘red-caped’ crusaders. It amazes me how certain leaders will take the lead in organizing a papal visit but shy away when the task is helping abused victims.”</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Father Mark Haight, after three assignments in parishes in the Albany Diocese, was confronted about his “inappropriate” behavior with children. The result? Church authorities forced him to enter counseling. As the reports states, “Haight refused and went on a leave of absence but taught children during that time.”</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>The Church’s utter refusal to report such crimes to authorities is as horrendous and evil as the crimes themselves.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>One of the Maryland churches, St. Mark Parish in Catonsville, housed 11 different child abusers.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>AG Brown stated about the abuses, “It’s a systemic failure of the Archdiocese to protect the most vulnerable — the children it was charged to keep safe. Time and again, the Archdiocese chose to safeguard the institution and avoid scandal instead of protecting the children in its care.”</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>The present Baltimore Archbishop, William E. Lori, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">responded to the report</a> in a lengthy statement, saying, “The detailed accounts of the abuse are shocking and soul searching. It is difficult for most to imagine that such evil acts could have actually occurred. For victim-survivors everywhere, they know the hard truth: These evil acts did occur.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>He later adds that there is a need for healing and a need for change, but notes it’s important to not ignore the sins of the past simply because they are in the past. “This Church of today is not the Church of yesterday but never would I ever say we’re done with this. No, I was not here when these things happened but I am the current pastor and there are people suffering now from what happened.”</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, since the cases cover over six decades of abuse, only one indictment is expected. This is due to many of the offenders having already passed away.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>However, there is a greater reason for the report. There are 15 states in the U.S. that have no statute of limitations for sexual abuse claims and 24 states that have exceptions, which includes previous claims that are expired under the statute of limitations to now be revived.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Maryland is not one of those states but on the heels of this 4-year investigation being concluded and widely discussed, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the state senate passed a bill</a> two weeks ago that will repeal the statute of limitations on child abuse. For it to become law, it now only requires the signature of the Maryland Governor Wes Moore, which is likely to happen soon since he has already previously expressed support of the bill.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>Additionally, the report will likely become a major catalyst for many other states to lift their statute of limitations. &nbsp;<br></p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=false>If you or a loved one are a survivor of CSA, support is available through <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network </a>(RAINN).
