Contestant Kiran MacCormick suffered a $4000 swing when he was deemed incorrect on a clue based on a debatable mispronunciation.
Returning champ Holly Hassel faced Suzanne Goldlust, a marketing manager from Reston, Virginia, and Kiran, a math teacher from Burlington, Vermont.
Holly is an English professor from Fargo, North Dakota, and the one to beat after inking out six-day champ Suresh Krishnan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Under “The U.S. Government” read: "Established in 1938, this congressional group was still issuing subpoenas in 1969 & finally ceased to exist 6 years later."</p><p>Holly and Suzanne were for the abbreviation of "HUAC" while Kiram spelled out the group in full and was unfortunitely incorrect with “Commission” as the last word was “Committee.”</p><p>Holly wagered everything jumping to $16000, but Suzanne wagered $1000 which was enough to make her the new champ.</p><h2>'SOUNDED OK'</h2><p>Fans in a Reddit internet forum felt for the newcomer and didn't agree with the costly ruling, many thought his response wasn't necessarily incorrect whether or not the results were impacted.</p><p>One person wrote: “Was surprised that Giorgione wasn’t accepted? Seemed like pretty reasonable pronunciation.”</p><p>Outgoing champ Suresh who watched the game agreed: “I was also surprised. I was in the audience and thought that sounded OK.”</p><p>A third person replied: “There wasn’t a protest by him or anything?”</p><p>Suresh replied he wasn’t sure: “You cannot really see from the audience if there was any protest.</p><p>"If you wanted to protest something you wait until the commercial break and talk to somebody in the contestant team who would convey it (not exactly sure how) to the judges and you would find out what happened after.”</p><p>A fifth person wrote: “I had to rewind the DVR. It sounded like he paused after the first syllable.</p><p>They are getting very strict with foreign-name pronunciations”</p><p>A sixth wrote: "Yes, just saying "George Gione" instead of Giorgione cost Kiran $4,000. That might've meant the difference in this being a runaway."</p><p>A seventh wrote: "Pretty harsh call on that final [too]. Didn’t matter anyway."</p><h2>EVERYONE'S RIGHT BUT ALSO WRONG</h2><p>An<a href=#> episode earlier this year</a> caused a major backlash when all three contestants including eventual <a href=#>8-day champ Hannah Wilson</a> were deemed incorrect with three different pronunciations of the correct name.</p><p>Mayim read the clue from "The Quotable Alex" - "The author and former prisoner that said 'socialism of any type and shade leads to a total destruction of the human spirit.'"</p><p>Each player guessed the right author, [Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn, but one by one Mayim ruled them each incorrect.</p><p>"This is a tricky one to pronounce," Mayim said.</p><p>"Eh I did not like that Solzhenitsyn ruling," one viewer tweeted.</p><p>"If you're not going to accept anyone's attempt to pronounce Solzhenitsyn, don't write a clue about him," another added.</p><p>Some fans explained&nbsp;in a thread&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Reddit</a>&nbsp;why they believed these types of tricky clues should be eliminated from the show.</p><p>"A good reason for them to abandon these types of clues. It's one thing with clues that ask about translation of common French or Spanish words or idioms, but&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;has several letters that are difficult for Americans."</p><p>Another argued that Wilson's pronunciation "fit within the guideline of being reasonably supported by the spelling."</p><p>"Give me a break. They all had the right name!" another viewer added.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Ken Jennings and the actress are the co-successors to&nbsp;<a href=#>the late, great Alex</a>, who passed away from cancer at age 80 in 2020.</p><p>Mayim is finishing out the regular season until the summer- barring the last week of Season 39 as&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim is bowing out and supporting the writers' strike</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/fans-accuse-mayim-bialik-penalizing-825280726.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/fans-accuse-mayim-bialik-penalizing-825280678.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/jeopardy-fans-left-upset-clue-816006410.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwY219en2WaKGep6CWv6XFjKaYsqGdYq%2BqrcuiomafmaS%2FqLXOp5xmqqWhtq%2BzjLCgp6aVp3q1u82inqGsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
