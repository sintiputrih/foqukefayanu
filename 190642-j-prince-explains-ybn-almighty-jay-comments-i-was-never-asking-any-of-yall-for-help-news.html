Prince stood up for YBN Almighty Jay after he was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">jumped by a group of men in New York</a>, losing his chain in the process. He ended up <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">requiring 300 stitches in his face</a>, rapping about the ordeal in his latest song "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Let Me Breathe</a>." The Rap-A-Lot Records founder called on Funk Flex, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Mysonne</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a>, A <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Boogie</a> wit da Hoodie, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Remy Ma</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Fat Joe</a>, and others from New York to unite in order to stop clout chasers, like Zae Numbafive and his crew, from achieving any sort of notoriety. Many were unimpressed with J. Prince's comments, calling him a snitch for calling out Zae. Yesterday, the goons that attacked Almighty Jay for his Rap-A-Lot chain were&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">arrested on unrelated attempted murder charges</a> and almost directly after, J. Prince came through with a clarification&nbsp;of his previous comments.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While it may have appeared as though he were asking his homies to do him a favor and mess up Zae Numbafive and his clique, J Prince quickly explained that he never actually asked for anybody's help. "I want to take this time to clarify my message to the people I tagged on my previous post," wrote the executive. "Let me make myself clear. I was never asking any of y’all for help in any capacity. I don’t need you, I don’t know you, or trust any of y’all to do anything concerning the streets for me. With that being said I witnessed a clown campaigning, bragging, and snitching on himself on a public video about robbing industry people in your backyard so I took it upon myself to alert the ones I have respect for."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Prince goes on to say that he's had ties in New York and the Bronx for a minute. This isn't anything new. He says that the people he tagged in the last post are not his friends, simply musicians that he respects. Then, he comes with a potent message to the "punk ass n***as" that tried to mess with him and his mob. "To all of you so called gangster clowns there’s a time and a place for everything and I’m going to give you what you ask for," wrote J Prince. "To all of you that’s trying to narrow down my message to me wanting a chain lacks the depth of understanding that real street niggas have. That’s why you are all squares. There’s a movement taking place by the timid and the weak that wants to change the meaning of strong to weak and the meaning of weak to strong. My track record speaks for itself so I won’t lip wrestle with punks."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhbn13gJFmoWaoop67pLGMnq%2BppJGeu7R52JulZpmcoraotNOyZKOZqWKwsLnMnqWtq12eerit0malnq6Vp3qiv8qipaBlkaPGbrvFZrCapJxis7C%2BjKGcpahdo7K4vw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
